Consider the following data set. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

4; 5; 6; 6; 6; 7; 7; 7; 7; 7; 7; 8; 8; 8; 9; 10

This data set can be represented by following histogram. Each interval has width one, and each value is located in the middle of an interval.

 ![This histogram matches the supplied data. It consists of 7 adjacent bars with the x-axis split into intervals of 1 from 4 to 10. The heighs of the bars peak in the middle and taper symmetrically to the right and left.](../resources/fig-ch02_08_01.jpg){: #M06_Ch02_fig001}

The histogram displays a **symmetrical** distribution of data. A distribution is symmetrical if a vertical line can be drawn at some point in the histogram such that the shape to the left and the right of the vertical line are mirror images of each other. The mean, the median, and the mode are each seven for these data. **In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, the mean and the median are the same.** This example has one mode (unimodal), and the mode is the same as the mean and median. In a symmetrical distribution that has two modes (bimodal), the two modes would be different from the mean and median.

The histogram for the data: <span data-type="list" data-list-type="labeled-item" id="set-00016s" data-display="inline"> <span data-type="item">4</span><span data-type="item">5</span><span data-type="item">6</span><span data-type="item">6</span><span data-type="item">6</span><span data-type="item">7</span><span data-type="item">7</span><span data-type="item">7</span><span data-type="item">7</span><span data-type="item">8</span></span> is not symmetrical. The right-hand side seems \"chopped off\" compared to the left side. A distribution of this type is called **skewed to the left** because it is pulled out to the left.

![This histogram matches the supplied data. It consists of 5 adjacent bars with the x-axis split into intervals of 1 from 4 to 8. The peak is to the right, and the heights of the bars taper down to the left.](../resources/fig-ch02_08_02.jpg){: #M06_Ch02_fig002}

The mean is 6.3, the median is 6.5, and the mode is seven. **Notice that the mean is less than the median, and they are both less than the mode.** The mean and the median both reflect the skewing, but the mean reflects it more so.

The histogram for the data: <span data-type="list" data-list-type="labeled-item" id="set-00017" data-display="inline"> <span data-type="item">6</span><span data-type="item">7</span><span data-type="item">7</span><span data-type="item">7</span><span data-type="item">7</span><span data-type="item">8</span><span data-type="item">8</span><span data-type="item">8</span><span data-type="item">9</span><span data-type="item">10</span></span>, is also not symmetrical. It is **skewed to the right**.

 ![This histogram matches the supplied data. It consists of 5 adjacent bars with the x-axis split into intervals of 1 from 6 to 10. The peak is to the left, and the heights of the bars taper down to the right.](../resources/fig-ch02_08_03.jpg){: #M06_Ch02_fig003}

The mean is 7.7, the median is 7.5, and the mode is seven. Of the three statistics, **the mean is the largest, while the mode is the smallest**. Again, the mean reflects the skewing the most.

To summarize, generally if the distribution of data is skewed to the left, the mean is less than the median, which is often less than the mode. If the distribution of data is skewed to the right, the mode is often less than the median, which is less than the mean.

Skewness and symmetry become important when we discuss probability distributions in later chapters.

2.  Terry’s mean is 3.7, Davis’ mean is 2.7, Maris’ mean is 4.6.
3.  Terry’s median is three, Davis’ median is three. Maris’ median is four.
4.  It appears that the median is always closest to the high point (the mode), while the mean tends to be farther out on the tail. In a symmetrical distribution, the mean and the median are both centrally located close to the high point of the distribution.

# Chapter Review

Looking at the distribution of data can reveal a lot about the relationship between the mean, the median, and the mode. There are <u data-effect="underline">three types of distributions. A **right (or positive) skewed** </u>distribution has a shape like [\[link\]](#M06_Ch02_fig002). A **left (or negative) skewed** distribution has a shape like [\[link\]](#M06_Ch02_fig003). A **symmetrical** distrubtion looks like [\[link\]](#M06_Ch02_fig001).

The data are skewed right. The median is 87.5 and the mean is 88.2. Even though they are close, the mode lies to the left of the middle of the data, and there are many more instances of 87 than any other number, so the data are skewed right.
