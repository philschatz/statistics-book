title: "Two Basic Rules of Probability"
layout: page
---


When calculating probability, there are two rules to consider when determining if two events are independent or dependent and if they are mutually exclusive or not.

# The Multiplication Rule   {#element-860}

If *A* and *B* are two events defined on a **sample space**{: data-type="term"}, then: *P*(*A* AND *B*) = *P*(*B*)*P*(*A*\|*B*).

This rule may also be written as: *P*(*A*\|*B*) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mtext> AND </mtext><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

(The probability of *A* given *B* equals the probability of *A* and *B* divided by the probability of *B*.)

If *A* and *B* are **independent**{: data-type="term"}, then *P*(*A*\|*B*) = *P*(*A*). Then *P*(*A* AND *B*) = *P*(*A*\|*B*)*P*(*B*) becomes *P*(*A* AND *B*) = *P*(*A*)*P*(*B*).

# The Addition Rule   {#element-56}

If *A* and *B* are defined on a sample space, then: *P*(*A* OR *B*) = *P*(*A*) + *P*(*B*) - *P*(*A* AND *B*).

If *A* and *B* are **mutually exclusive**{: data-type="term"}, then *P*(*A* AND *B*) = 0. Then *P*(*A* OR *B*) = *P*(*A*) + *P*(*B*) - *P*(*A* AND *B*) becomes *P*(*A* OR *B*) = *P*(*A*) + *P*(*B*).

<div data-type="example" id="element-898" markdown="1">
Klaus is trying to choose where to go on vacation. His two choices are: *A* = New Zealand and *B* = Alaska

* Klaus can only afford one vacation. The probability that he chooses *A* is *P*(*A*) = 0.6 and the probability that he chooses *B* is *P*(*B*) = 0.35.
* *P*(*A* AND *B*) = 0 because Klaus can only afford to take one vacation
* Therefore, the probability that he chooses either New Zealand or Alaska is *P*(*A* OR *B*) = *P*(*A*) + *P*(*B*) = 0.6 + 0.35 = 0.95. Note that the probability that he does not choose to go anywhere on vacation must be 0.05.

Carlos plays college soccer. He makes a goal 65% of the time he shoots. Carlos is going to attempt two goals in a row in the next game. *A* = the event Carlos is successful on his first attempt. *P*(*A*) = 0.65. *B* = the event Carlos is successful on his second attempt. *P*(*B*) = 0.65. Carlos tends to shoot in streaks. The probability that he makes the second goal **GIVEN** that he made the first goal is 0.90.* * *

<div data-type="solution" id="id20946912" markdown="1">
a. The problem is asking you to find *P*(*A* AND *B*) = *P*(*B* AND *A*). Since *P*(*B*|*A*) = 0.90: *P*(*B* AND *A*) = *P*(*B*|*A*) *P*(*A*) = (0.90)(0.65) = 0.585

# Chapter Review

The multiplication rule and the addition rule are used for computing the probability of *A* and *B*, as well as the probability of *A* or *B* for two given events *A*, *B* defined on the sample space. In sampling with replacement each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, so that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once, and the events are considered to be independent. In sampling without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once, and the events are considered to be not independent. The events *A* and *B* are mutually exclusive events when they do not have any outcomes in common.

# Formula Review

**The multiplication rule:** *P*(*A* AND *B*) = *P*(*A*\|*B*)*P*(*B*)

**The addition rule:** *P*(*A* OR *B*) = *P*(*A*) + *P*(*B*) - *P*(*A* AND *B*)

# Homework

On February 28, 2013, a Field Poll Survey reported that 61% of California registered voters approved of allowing two people of the same gender to marry and have regular marriage laws apply to them. Among 18 to 39 year olds (California registered voters), the approval rating was 78%. Six in ten California registered voters said that the upcoming Supreme Court’s ruling about the constitutionality of California’s Proposition 8 was either very or somewhat important to them. Out of those CA registered voters who support same-sex marriage, 75% say the ruling is important to them.

In this problem, let:

* *C* = California registered voters who support same-sex marriage.
* *B* = California registered voters who say the Supreme Court’s ruling about the constitutionality of California’s Proposition 8 is very or somewhat important to them
* *A* = California registered voters who are 18 to 39 years old.

After Rob Ford, the mayor of Toronto, announced his plans to cut budget costs in late 2011, the Forum Research polled 1,046 people to measure the mayor’s popularity. Everyone polled expressed either approval or disapproval. These are the results their poll produced:

* In early 2011, 60 percent of the population approved of Mayor Ford’s actions in office.
* In mid-2011, 57 percent of the population approved of his actions.
* In late 2011, the percentage of popular approval was measured at 42 percent.

1.  What is the sample size for this study?
2.  What proportion in the poll disapproved of Mayor Ford, according to the results from late 2011?
3.  How many people polled responded that they approved of Mayor Ford in late 2011?

1.  *P*(type O OR Rh-) = *P*(type O) + *P*(Rh-) - *P*(type O AND Rh-)
    
    0\.52 = 0.43 + 0.15 - *P*(type O AND Rh-); solve to find *P*(type O AND Rh-) = 0.06
    
    6% of people have type O, Rh- blood

2.  *P*(NOT(type O AND Rh-)) = 1 - *P*(type O AND Rh-) = 1 - 0.06 = 0.94
    
    94% of people do not have type O, Rh- blood

At a college, 72% of courses have final exams and 46% of courses require research papers. Suppose that 32% of courses have a research paper and a final exam. Let *F* be the event that a course has a final exam. Let *R* be the event that a course requires a research paper.

1.  Find the probability that a course has a final exam or a research project.
2.  Find the probability that a course has NEITHER of these two requirements.

In a box of assorted cookies, 36% contain chocolate and 12% contain nuts. Of those, 8% contain both chocolate and nuts. Sean is allergic to both chocolate and nuts.

1.  Find the probability that a cookie contains chocolate or nuts (he can't eat it).
2.  Find the probability that a cookie does not contain chocolate or nuts (he can eat it).

A college finds that 10% of students have taken a distance learning class and that 40% of students are part time students. Of the part time students, 20% have taken a distance learning class. Let *D* = event that a student takes a distance learning class and *E* = event that a student is a part time student

1.  Find *P*(*D* AND *E*).
2.  Find *P*(*E*|*D*).
3.  Find *P*(*D* OR *E*).
4.  Using an appropriate test, show whether *D* and *E* are independent.
5.  Using an appropriate test, show whether *D* and *E* are mutually exclusive.
