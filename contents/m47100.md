Linear regression for two variables is based on a linear equation with one independent variable. The equation has the form:

<div data-type="equation" id="element-987">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"> <mi>y</mi> <mo>=</mo> <mi>a</mi> <mo>+</mo> <mtext>bx</mtext> </math>
</div>

* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

where *a* and *b* are constant numbers.

The variable ***x* is the independent variable, and *y* is the dependent variable.** Typically, you choose a value to substitute for the independent variable and then solve for the dependent variable.

### Slope and *Y*-Intercept of a Linear Equation

For the linear equation *y* = *a* + *bx*, *b* = slope and *a* = *y*-intercept. From algebra recall that the slope is a number that describes the steepness of a line, and the *y*-intercept is the *y* coordinate of the point (0, *a*) where the line crosses the *y*-axis.

![Three possible graphs of the equation y = a + bx. For the first graph, (a), b &gt; 0 and so the line slopes upward to the right. For the second, b = 0 and the graph of the equation is a horizontal line. In the third graph, (c), b &lt; 0 and the line slopes downward to the right.](../resources/fig-ch12_03_01.jpg "Three possible graphs of y = a + bx. (a) If b &gt; 0, the line slopes upward to the right. (b) If b = 0, the line is horizontal. (c) If b &lt; 0, the line slopes downward to the right."){: #linrgs_slope1}

### Chapter Review   {#eip-645}

The most basic type of association is a linear association. This type of relationship can be defined algebraically by the equations used, numerically with actual or predicted data values, or graphically from a plotted curve. (Lines are classified as straight curves.) Algebraically, a linear equation typically takes the form ***y = mx + b***, where ***m*** and ***b*** are constants, ***x*** is the independent variable, ***y*** is the dependent variable. In a statistical context, a linear equation is written in the form ***y = a + bx***, where ***a*** and ***b*** are the constants. This form is used to help readers distinguish the statistical context from the algebraic context. In the equation *y = a + bx*, the constant *b* that multiplies the ***x*** variable (*b* is called a coefficient) is called as the **slope**. The slope describes the rate of change between the independent and dependent variables; in other words, the rate of change describes the change that occurs in the dependent variable as the independent variable is changed. In the equation *y = a + bx*, the constant a is called as the *y*-intercept. Graphically, the *y*-intercept is the *y* coordinate of the point where the graph of the line crosses the *y* axis. At this point *x* = 0.

The **slope of a line** is a value that describes the rate of change between the independent and dependent variables. The **slope** tells us how the dependent variable (*y*) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (*x*) variable, on average. The ***y*-intercept** is used to describe the dependent variable when the independent variable equals zero. Graphically, the slope is represented by three line types in elementary statistics.

### Formula Review   {#eip-190}

*y* = *a* + *bx* where *a* is the *y*-intercept and *b* is the slope. The variable *x* is the independent variable and *y* is the dependent variable.

Piece-rate systems are widely debated incentive payment plans. In a recent study of loan officer effectiveness, the following piece-rate system was examined:

<table summary=".."><caption><span data-type="title" /></caption><tbody>
<tr>
<td>% of goal reached</td>
<td>&lt; 80</td>
<td>80</td>
<td>100</td>
<td>120</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Incentive</td>
<td>n/a</td>
<td>$4,000 with an additional $125 added per percentage point from 81–99%</td>
<td>$6,500 with an additional $125 added per percentage point from 101–119%</td>
<td>$9,500 with an additional $125 added per percentage point starting at 121%</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
If a loan officer makes 95% of his or her goal, write the linear function that applies based on the incentive plan table. In context, explain the *y*-intercept and slope.
