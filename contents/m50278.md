<span data-type="title">Increasing Stocks Survey</span>* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

Look at yesterday’s newspaper business section. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the proportion of New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks that increased is greater than the proportion of NASDAQ stocks that increased. As randomly as possible, choose 40 NYSE stocks, and 32 NASDAQ stocks and complete the following statements.

1.  *H<sub>0</sub>\: \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_*
2.  *H<sub>a</sub>\: \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_*
3.  In words, define the random variable.
4.  The distribution to use for the test is \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_.
5.  Calculate the test statistic using your data.
6.  Draw a graph and label it appropriately. Shade the actual level of significance.
    1.  Graph: ![This is a blank graph template. The vertical and horizontal axes are unlabeled.](../resources/fig-ch10_11_02.png){: #id6690350}


    2.  Calculate the *p*-value.
    {: type="a"}

7.  Do you reject or not reject the null hypothesis? Why?
8.  Write a clear conclusion using a complete sentence.

<span data-type="title">Decreasing Stocks Survey</span> * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

Randomly pick eight stocks from the newspaper. Using two consecutive days’ business sections, test whether the stocks went down, on average, for the second day.

1.  *H<sub>0</sub>*\: \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_
2.  *H<sub>a</sub>\: \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_*
3.  In words, define the random variable.
4.  The distribution to use for the test is \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_.
5.  Calculate the test statistic using your data.
6.  Draw a graph and label it appropriately. Shade the actual level of significance.
    1.  Graph:![This is a blank graph template. The vertical and horizontal axes are unlabeled.](../resources/fig-ch10_11_02.png){: #id8343352}


    2.  Calculate the *p*-value:
    {: type="a"}

7.  Do you reject or not reject the null hypothesis? Why?
8.  Write a clear conclusion using a complete sentence.
{: data-mark-suffix="."}

<span data-type="title">Candy Survey</span> Buy three small packages of M&amp;Ms and five small packages of Reese\'s Pieces (same net weight as the M&amp;Ms). Test whether or not the mean number of candy pieces per package is the same for the two brands.

1.  *H<sub>0</sub>*\: \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_
2.  *H<sub>a</sub>*\: \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_
3.  In words, define the random variable.
4.  What distribution should be used for this test?
5.  Calculate the test statistic using your data.
6.  Draw a graph and label it appropriately. Shade the actual level of significance.
    1.  Graph:![This is a blank graph template. The vertical and horizontal axes are unlabeled.](../resources/fig-ch10_11_03.png){: #id8343564}


    2.  Calculate the *p*-value.

7.  Do you reject or not reject the null hypothesis? Why?
8.  Write a clear conclusion using a complete sentence.
