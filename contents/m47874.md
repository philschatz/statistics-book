#### Part II: Univariate Data   {#element-645}

In this section, you will use the data for **ONE** variable only. Pick the variable that is more interesting to analyze. For example: if your independent variable is sequential data such as year with 30 years and one piece of data per year, your *x*-values might be 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, …, 2000. This would not be interesting to analyze. In that case, choose to use the dependent variable to analyze for this part of the project. * * *

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Does the middle 50% of your data appear to be concentrated together or spread out? Explain how you determined this. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_Looking at both the histogram AND the box plot, discuss the distribution of your data. For example: how does the spread of the middle 50% of your data compare to the spread of the rest of the data represented in the box plot; how does this correspond to your description of the shape of the histogram; how does the graphical display show any outliers you may have found; does the histogram show any gaps in the data that are not visible in the box plot; are there any interesting features of your data that you should point out.
