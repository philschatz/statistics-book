title: "Null and Alternative Hypotheses"
layout: page
---


The actual test begins by considering two **hypotheses**{: data-type="term"}. They are called the **null hypothesis**{: data-type="term"} and the **alternative hypothesis**{: data-type="term"}. These hypotheses contain opposing viewpoints.

*H<sub>0</sub>*\: **The null hypothesis:** It is a statement of no difference between sample means or proportions or no difference between a sample mean or proportion and a population mean or proportion. In other words, the difference equals 0.

*H<sub>a</sub>*\: **The alternative hypothesis:** It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to *H<sub>0</sub>* and what we conclude when we reject *H<sub>0</sub>*.

Since the null and alternative hypotheses are contradictory, you must examine evidence to decide if you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. The evidence is in the form of sample data.

After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a **decision.** There are two options for a decision. They are \"reject *H<sub>0</sub>*\" if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis or \"do not reject *H<sub>0</sub>*\" or \"decline to reject *H<sub>0</sub>*\" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis.

Mathematical Symbols Used in *H<sub>0</sub>* and *H<sub>a</sub>*\:

| *H<sub>0</sub>* | *H<sub>a</sub>* |
|----------
{: valign="middle"}| equal (=) | not equal (≠) **or** greater than (&gt;) **or** less than (&lt;) |
| greater than or equal to (≥) | less than (&lt;) |

*H<sub>0</sub>* always has a symbol with an equal in it. *H<sub>a</sub>* never has a symbol with an equal in it. The choice of symbol depends on the wording of the hypothesis test. However, be aware that many researchers (including one of the co-authors in research work) use = in the null hypothesis, even with &gt; or &lt; as the symbol in the alternative hypothesis. This practice is acceptable because we only make the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.

### Chapter Review   {#eip-591}

In a **hypothesis test**, sample data is evaluated in order to arrive at a decision about some type of claim. If certain conditions about the sample are satisfied, then the claim can be evaluated for a population. In a hypothesis test, we:

1.  Evaluate the **null hypothesis**, typically denoted with *H<sub>0</sub>*. The null is not rejected unless the hypothesis test shows otherwise. The null statement must always contain some form of equality (=, ≤ or ≥)
2.  Always write the **alternative hypothesis**, typically denoted with *H<sub>a</sub>* or *H<sub>1</sub>*, using less than, greater than, or not equals symbols, i.e., (≠, &gt;, or &lt;).
3.  If we reject the null hypothesis, then we can assume there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.
4.  Never state that a claim is proven true or false. Keep in mind the underlying fact that hypothesis testing is based on probability laws; therefore, we can talk only in terms of non-absolute certainties.

### Formula Review

*H<sub>0</sub>* and *H<sub>a</sub>* are contradictory.

| **If *H<sub>o</sub>* has:** | equal (=) | greater than or equal to (≥) | less than or equal to (≤) |
| **then *H<sub>a</sub>* has:** | not equal (≠) **or** greater than (&gt;) **or** less than (&lt;) | less than (&lt;) | greater than (&gt;) |
{: #element-377 summary="This table states the mathematical symbols associated with either null or alternate hypothesis. The first row is for the null hypothesis and the second row is for the alternate hypothesis. There are three columns of mathematical symbols for each."}

If *α* ≤ *p*-value, then do not reject *H<sub>0</sub>*.

If *α* &gt; *p*-value, then reject *H<sub>0</sub>*.

*α* is preconceived. Its value is set before the hypothesis test starts. The *p*-value is calculated from the data.

Suppose that a recent article stated that the mean time spent in jail by a first–time convicted burglar is 2.5 years. A study was then done to see if the mean time has increased in the new century. A random sample of 26 first-time convicted burglars in a recent year was picked. The mean length of time in jail from the survey was 3 years with a standard deviation of 1.8 years. Suppose that it is somehow known that the population standard deviation is 1.5. If you were conducting a hypothesis test to determine if the mean length of jail time has increased, what would the null and alternative hypotheses be? The distribution of the population is normal.
