title: "Null and Alternative Hypotheses"
layout: page
---


The actual test begins by considering two **hypotheses**{: data-type="term"}. They are called the **null hypothesis**{: data-type="term"} and the **alternative hypothesis**{: data-type="term"}. These hypotheses contain opposing viewpoints.

*H<sub>0</sub>*\: **The null hypothesis:** It is a statement about the population that either is believed to be true or is used to put forth an argument unless it can be shown to be incorrect beyond a reasonable doubt.

*H<sub>a</sub>*\: **The alternative hypothesis:** It is a claim about the population that is contradictory to *H<sub>0</sub>* and what we conclude when we reject *H<sub>0</sub>*.

Since the null and alternative hypotheses are contradictory, you must examine evidence to decide if you have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis or not. The evidence is in the form of sample data.

After you have determined which hypothesis the sample supports, you make a **decision.** There are two options for a decision. They are \"reject *H<sub>0</sub>*\" if the sample information favors the alternative hypothesis or \"do not reject *H<sub>0</sub>*\" or \"decline to reject *H<sub>0</sub>*\" if the sample information is insufficient to reject the null hypothesis.

Mathematical Symbols Used in *H<sub>0</sub>* and *H<sub>a</sub>*\: | *H<sub>0</sub>* | *H<sub>a</sub>* |
|----------
{: valign="middle"}| equal (=) | not equal (≠) **or** greater than (&gt;) **or** less than (&lt;) |
| greater than or equal to (≥) | less than (&lt;) |
| less than or equal to (≤) | more than (&gt;) |

*H<sub>0</sub>* always has a symbol with an equal in it. *H<sub>a</sub>* never has a symbol with an equal in it. The choice of symbol depends on the wording of the hypothesis test. However, be aware that many researchers (including one of the co-authors in research work) use = in the null hypothesis, even with &gt; or &lt; as the symbol in the alternative hypothesis. This practice is acceptable because we only make the decision to reject or not reject the null hypothesis.

# Chapter Review   {#eip-591}

In a **hypothesis test**, sample data is evaluated in order to arrive at a decision about some type of claim. If certain conditions about the sample are satisfied, then the claim can be evaluated for a population. In a hypothesis test, we: <div data-type="list" data-list-type="enumerated" id="eip-idp72518864" data-number-style="arabic">
<div data-type="item">
Evaluate the **null hypothesis**, typically denoted with *H<sub>0</sub>*. The null is not rejected unless the hypothesis test shows otherwise. The null statement must always contain some form of equality (=, ≤ or ≥)
</div>
<div data-type="item">
Always write the **alternative hypothesis**, typically denoted with *H<sub>a</sub>* or *H<sub>1</sub>*, using less than, greater than, or not equals symbols, i.e., (≠, &gt;, or &lt;).
</div>
<div data-type="item">
If we reject the null hypothesis, then we can assume there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.

Never state that a claim is proven true or false. Keep in mind the underlying fact that hypothesis testing is based on probability laws; therefore, we can talk only in terms of non-absolute certainties.

*α* is preconceived. Its value is set before the hypothesis test starts. The *p*-value is calculated from the data.
