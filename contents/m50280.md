1.  Using your class as a sample, complete the following chart. Ask each other what your favorite snack is, then total the results.
    <div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" id="eip-998" data-label="">
    <div data-type="title">
    Note
    </div>
    You may need to combine two food categories so that each cell has an expected value of at least five.

    <table id="id89871qw3984l8" summary="This table presents the favorite type of snack in columns 2-5 and the total in the sixth column. The first row is male, the second row is female, and the third row is total."><caption><span data-type="title">Favorite type of snack</span></caption><thead>

<span data-type="title">Hypothesis Test</span> Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the factors are independent:

1.  *H<sub>0</sub>*\: \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_
2.  *H<sub>a</sub>*\: \\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_\\\_
3.  What distribution should you use for a hypothesis test?
4.  Why did you choose this distribution?
5.  Calculate the test statistic.
6.  Find the *p*-value.
7.  Sketch a graph of the situation. Label and scale the *x*-axis. Shade the area corresponding to the *p*-value. ![Blank graph with vertical and horizontal axes.](../resources/fig-ch11_16_01.png){: #id3390530}


8.  State your decision.
9.  State your conclusion in a complete sentence.
