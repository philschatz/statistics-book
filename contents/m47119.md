title: "Facts About the F Distribution"
layout: page
---


**Here are some facts about the *F* distribution.**

1.  The curve is not symmetrical but skewed to the right.
2.  There is a different curve for each set of *df*s.
3.  The *F* statistic is greater than or equal to zero.
4.  As the degrees of freedom for the numerator and for the denominator get larger, the curve approximates the normal.
5.  Other uses for the *F* distribution include comparing two variances and two-way Analysis of Variance. Two-Way Analysis is beyond the scope of this chapter.

![This graph has an unmarked Y axis and then an X axis that ranges from 0.00 to 4.00. It has three plot lines. The plot line labelled F subscript 1, 5 starts near the top of the Y axis at the extreme left of the graph and drops quickly to near the bottom at 0.50, at which point is slowly decreases in a curved fashion to the 4.00 mark on the X axis. The plot line labelled F subscript 100, 100 remains at Y = 0 for much of its length, except for a distinct peak between 0.50 and 1.50. The peak is a smooth curve that reaches about half way up the Y axis at its peak. The plot line labeled F subscript 5, 10 increases slightly as it progresses from 0.00 to 0.50, after which it peaks and slowly decreases down the remainder of the X axis. The peak only reaches about one fifth up the height of the Y axis.](../resources/OSX_Spec_StatisticsTEA_Figure_13_03_01.jpg){:}

Let’s return to the slicing tomato exercise in [[link]](/m47128#fs-idp19091024). The means of the tomato yields under the five mulching conditions are represented by *μ*<sub>1</sub>, *μ*<sub>2</sub>, *μ*<sub>3</sub>, *μ*<sub>4</sub>, *μ*<sub>5</sub>. We will conduct a hypothesis test to determine if all means are the same or at least one is different. Using a significance level of 5%, test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean yields among the five groups against the alternative hypothesis that at least one mean is different from the rest.

**Distribution for the test: *F*<sub>4,10</sub>**

**Test statistic:** *F* = 4.4810

**Probability Statement:** *p*-value = *P*(*F* &gt; 4.481) = 0.0248.

**Compare *α* and the *p*-value:** *α* = 0.05, *p*-value = 0.0248

**Make a decision:** Since *α* &gt; *p*-value, we reject *H<sub>0</sub>*.

**Conclusion:** At the 5% significance level, we have reasonably strong evidence that differences in mean yields for slicing tomato plants grown under different mulching conditions are unlikely to be due to chance alone. We may conclude that at least some of mulches led to different mean yields.

A fourth grade class is studying the environment. One of the assignments is to grow bean plants in different soils. Tommy chose to grow his bean plants in soil found outside his classroom mixed with dryer lint. Tara chose to grow her bean plants in potting soil bought at the local nursery. Nick chose to grow his bean plants in soil from his mother\'s garden. No chemicals were used on the plants, only water. They were grown inside the classroom next to a large window. Each child grew five plants. At the end of the growing period, each plant was measured, producing the data (in inches) in [\[link\]](#table-234).

 .

First, calculate the sample mean and sample variance of each group.

|  | Tommy's Plants | Tara's Plants | Nick's Plants |
|----------
{: valign="top"}| Sample Mean | 24.2 | 25.4 | 24.4 |
| Sample Variance | 11.7 | 18.3 | 16.3 |
{: #table-9634 summary="This table presents Tommy's plant heights in the first column, Tara's plant heights in the second column, and Nick's plant heights in the third column. The first row represents the sample mean and the second row represents the sample variance."}

Next, calculate the variance of the three group means (Calculate the variance of 24.2, 25.4, and 24.4). **Variance of the group means = 0.413** = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msub> <mi>s</mi> <mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> </msub> <msup> <mrow /> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> </math>

 = (5)(0.413) where *n* = 5 is the sample size (number of plants each child grew).

Calculate the mean of the three sample variances (Calculate the mean of 11.7, 18.3, and 16.3). **Mean of the sample variances = 15.433** = ***s***<sup>2</sup> ***pooled***

Then *MS<sub>within</sub>* = *s*<sup>2</sup><sub>*pooled*</sub> = 15.433.

The *F* statistic (or *F* ratio) is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mi>F</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mi>M</mi><msub> <mi>S</mi> <mrow> <mtext>between</mtext> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>M</mi><msub> <mi>S</mi> <mrow> <mtext>within</mtext> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><msub> <mi>s</mi> <mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> </msub> <msup> <mrow /> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> <mrow> <msup> <mi>s</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msup> <msub> <mrow /> <mrow> <mi>p</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>5</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>0.413</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>15.433</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mn>0.134</mn> </mrow> </math>

The *dfs* for the numerator = the number of groups – 1 = 3 – 1 = 2.

The *dfs* for the denominator = the total number of samples – the number of groups = 15 – 3 = 12

The distribution for the test is *F*<sub>2,12</sub> and the *F* statistic is *F* = 0.134

The *p*-value is *P*(*F* &gt; 0.134) = 0.8759.

**Decision:** Since *α* = 0.03 and the *p*-value = 0.8759, do not reject *H<sub>0</sub>*. (Why?)

**Conclusion:** With a 3% level of significance, from the sample data, the evidence is not sufficient to conclude that the mean heights of the bean plants are different.

### Chapter Review

The graph of the *F* distribution is always positive and skewed right, though the shape can be mounded or exponential depending on the combination of numerator and denominator degrees of freedom. The *F* statistic is the ratio of a measure of the variation in the group means to a similar measure of the variation within the groups. If the null hypothesis is correct, then the numerator should be small compared to the denominator. A small *F* statistic will result, and the area under the *F* curve to the right will be large, representing a large *p*-value. When the null hypothesis of equal group means is incorrect, then the numerator should be large compared to the denominator, giving a large *F* statistic and a small area (small *p*-value) to the right of the statistic under the *F* curve.

When the data have unequal group sizes (unbalanced data), then techniques from [\[link\]](/m47128) need to be used for hand calculations. In the case of balanced data (the groups are the same size) however, simplified calculations based on group means and variances may be used. In practice, of course, software is usually employed in the analysis. As in any analysis, graphs of various sorts should be used in conjunction with numerical techniques. Always look of your data!

DDT is a pesticide that has been banned from use in the United States and most other areas of the world. It is quite effective, but persisted in the environment and over time became seen as harmful to higher-level organisms. Famously, egg shells of eagles and other raptors were believed to be thinner and prone to breakage in the nest because of ingestion of DDT in the food chain of the birds.

An experiment was conducted on the number of eggs (fecundity) laid by female fruit flies. There are three groups of flies. One group was bred to be resistant to DDT (the RS group). Another was bred to be especially susceptible to DDT (SS). Finally there was a control line of non-selected or typical fruitflies (NS). Here are the data:

| RS | SS | NS | RS | SS | NS |
|----------
| 12.8 | 38.4 | 35.4 | 22.4 | 23.1 | 22.6 |

The values are the average number of eggs laid daily for each of 75 flies (25 in each group) over the first 14 days of their lives. Using a 1% level of significance, are the mean rates of egg selection for the three strains of fruitfly different? If so, in what way? Specifically, the researchers were interested in whether or not the selectively bred strains were different from the nonselected line, and whether the two selected lines were different from each other.

Here is a chart of the three groups:

![This graph is a scatterplot which represents the data provided. The horizontal axis is labeled \'Mean eggs laid per day\' and extends from 10 - 50. The vertical axis is labeled \'Fruitflies DDT resistant or susceptible, or not selected.\' The vertical axis is labeled with the categories NS, RS, SS.](../resources/CNX_Stats_C13_M04_007.jpg){:}


</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="eip-601" markdown="1">
The data appear normally distributed from the chart and of similar spread. There do not appear to be any serious outliers, so we may proceed with our ANOVA calculations, to see if we have good evidence of a difference between the three groups.

*H<sub>0</sub>*: *μ*<sub>1</sub> = *μ*<sub>2</sub> = *μ*<sub>3</sub>;

*H*<sub>a</sub>: *μ*<sub>i</sub> ≠ *μ*<sub>j</sub> some *i* ≠ *j*.

Define *μ*<sub>1</sub>, *μ*<sub>2</sub>, *μ*<sub>3</sub>, as the population mean number of eggs laid by the three groups of fruit flies.

*F* statistic = 8.6657;

*p*-value = 0.0004

![This graph shows a nonsymmetrical F distribution curve. This curve does not have a peak, but slopes downward from a maximum value at (0, 1.0) and approaches the horiztonal axis at the right edge of the graph.](../resources/CNX_Stats_C13_M04_008.jpg){:}


**<u data-effect="underline">Decision:</u>** Since the *p*-value is less than the level of significance of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis.

**<u data-effect="underline">Conclusion:</u>** We have good evidence that the average number of eggs laid during the first 14 days of life for these three strains of fruitflies are different.

Interestingly, if you perform a two sample *t*-test to compare the RS and NS groups they are significantly different (*p* = 0.0013). Similarly, SS and NS are significantly different (*p* = 0.0006). However, the two selected groups, RS and SS are *not* significantly different (*p* = 0.5176). Thus we appear to have good evidence that selection either for resistance or for susceptibility involves a reduced rate of egg production (for these specific strains) as compared to flies that were not selected for resistance or susceptibility to DDT. Here, genetic selection has apparently involved a loss of fecundity.
