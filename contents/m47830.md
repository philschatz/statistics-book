<div data-type="abstract">
Introductory Statistics is intended for the one-semester introduction to statistics course for students who are not mathematics or engineering majors. It focuses on the interpretation of statistical results, especially in real world settings, and assumes that students have an understanding of intermediate algebra. In addition to end of section practice and homework sets, examples of each topic are explained step-by-step throughout the text and followed by a Try It problem that is designed as extra practice for students. This book also includes collaborative exercises and statistics labs designed to give students the opportunity to work together and explore key concepts. To support today’s student in understanding technology, this book features TI 83, 83+, 84, or 84+ calculator instructions at strategic points throughout. While the book has been built so that each chapter builds on the previous, it can be rearranged to accommodate any instructor’s particular needs.

Welcome to *Introductory Statistics*, an OpenStax resource. This textbook was written to increase student access to high-quality learning materials, maintaining highest standards of academic rigor at little to no cost.

The foundation of this textbook is *Collaborative Statistics*, by Barbara Illowsky and Susan Dean. Additional topics, examples, and innovations in terminology and practical applications have been added, all with a goal of increasing relevance and accessibility for students.

### About OpenStax   {#eip-10}

OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it’s our mission to improve student access to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012, and our library has since scaled to over 25 books for college and AP<sup>®</sup> courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. OpenStax Tutor, our low-cost personalized learning tool, is being used in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.

### Alternate sequencing   {#eip-876}

*Introductory Statistics* was conceived and written to fit a particular topical sequence, but it can be used flexibly to accommodate other course structures. One such potential structure, which fits reasonably well with the textbook content, is provided below. Please consider, however, that the chapters were not written to be completely independent, and that the proposed alternate sequence should be carefully considered for student preparation and textual consistency.

### Pedagogical foundation and features   {#eip-930}

* **Examples** are placed strategically throughout the text to show students the step-by-step process of interpreting and solving statistical problems. To keep the text relevant for students, the examples are drawn from a broad spectrum of practical topics, including examples about college life and learning, health and medicine, retail and business, and sports and entertainment.
* **Try It** practice problems immediately follow many examples and give students the opportunity to practice as they read the text. **They are usually based on practical and familiar topics, like the Examples themselves**.
* **Collaborative Exercises** provide an in-class scenario for students to work together to explore presented concepts.
* **Using the TI-83, 83+, 84, 84+ Calculator** shows students step-by-step instructions to input problems into their calculator.
* **The Technology Icon** indicates where the use of a TI calculator or computer software is recommended.
* **Practice, Homework, and Bringing It Together** problems give the students problems at various degrees of difficulty while also including real-world scenarios to engage students.

### Statistics labs   {#eip-600}

These innovative activities were developed by Barbara Illowsky and Susan Dean in order to offer students the experience of designing, implementing, and interpreting statistical analyses. They are drawn from actual experiments and data-gathering processes and offer a unique hands-on and collaborative experience. The labs provide a foundation for further learning and classroom interaction that will produce a meaningful application of statistics.

Statistics Labs appear at the end of each chapter and begin with student learning outcomes, general estimates for time on task, and any global implementation notes. Students are then provided with step-by-step guidance, including sample data tables and calculation prompts. The detailed assistance will help the students successfully apply the concepts in the text and lay the groundwork for future collaborative or individual work.

### Additional resources   {#eip-382}

#### Student and instructor resources   {#eip-id8911316}

We’ve compiled additional resources for both students and instructors, including Getting Started Guides, an instructor solution manual, and PowerPoint slides. Instructor resources require a verified instructor account, which you can apply for when you log in or create your account on [OpenStax.org](openstax.org). Take advantage of these resources to supplement your OpenStax book.

#### Community hubs   {#eip-365}

OpenStax partners with the Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME) to offer Community Hubs on OER Commons – a platform for instructors to share community-created resources that support OpenStax books, free of charge. Through our Community Hubs, instructors can upload their own materials or download resources to use in their own courses, including additional ancillaries, teaching material, multimedia, and relevant course content. We encourage instructors to join the hubs for the subjects most relevant to your teaching and research as an opportunity both to enrich your courses and to engage with other faculty.  

To reach the Community Hubs, visit [www.oercommons.org/hubs/OpenStax](&#x2028;www.oercommons.org/hubs/OpenStax).
