title: "Hypergeometric Distribution"
layout: page
---


There are five characteristics of a hypergeometric experiment.

1.  You take samples from **two** groups.
2.  You are concerned with a group of interest, called the first group.
3.  You sample **without replacement** from the combined groups. For example, you want to choose a softball team from a combined group of 11 men and 13 women. The team consists of ten players.
4.  Each pick is **not** independent, since sampling is without replacement. In the softball example, the probability of picking a woman first is

    . The probability of picking a man second is

    if a woman was picked first. It is

    if a man was picked first. The probability of the second pick depends on what happened in the first pick.
5.  You are **not** dealing with Bernoulli Trials.

The outcomes of a hypergeometric experiment fit a **hypergeometric probability**{: data-type="term"} distribution. The random variable *X* = the number of items from the group of interest.

A candy dish contains 100 jelly beans and 80 gumdrops. Fifty candies are picked at random. What is the probability that 35 of the 50 are gumdrops? The two groups are jelly beans and gumdrops. Since the probability question asks for the probability of picking gumdrops, the group of interest (first group) is gumdrops. The size of the group of interest (first group) is 80. The size of the second group is 100. The size of the sample is 50 (jelly beans or gumdrops). Let *X* = the number of gumdrops in the sample of 50. *X* takes on the values *x* = 0, 1, 2, ..., 50. What is the probability statement written mathematically?

Suppose a shipment of 100 DVD players is known to have ten defective players. An inspector randomly chooses 12 for inspection. He is interested in determining the probability that, among the 12 players, at most two are defective. The two groups are the 90 non-defective DVD players and the 10 defective DVD players. The group of interest (first group) is the defective group because the probability question asks for the probability of at most two defective DVD players. The size of the sample is 12 DVD players.

*X* ~ *H*(*r*, *b*, *n*)

Read this as \"*X* is a random variable with a hypergeometric distribution.\" The parameters are *r*, *b*, and *n*; *r* = the size of the group of interest (first group), *b* = the size of the second group, *n* = the size of the chosen sample.

# Chapter Review

A **hypergeometric experiment**{: data-type="term"} is a statistical experiment with the following properties:

1.  You take samples from two groups.
2.  You are concerned with a group of interest, called the first group.
3.  You sample without replacement from the combined groups.
4.  Each pick is not independent, since sampling is without replacement.
5.  You are not dealing with Bernoulli Trials.

The outcomes of a hypergeometric experiment fit a hypergeometric probability distribution. The random variable *X* = the number of items from the group of interest. The distribution of *X* is denoted *X* ~ *H*(*r*, *b*, *n*), where *r* = the size of the group of interest (first group), *b* = the size of the second group, and *n* = the size of the chosen sample. It follows that * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

*n* ≤ *r* + *b*. The mean of *X* is *μ* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>r</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>r</mi><mtext> + </mtext><mi>b</mi> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

 and the standard deviation is *σ* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>r</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mtext> + </mtext><mi>b</mi><mtext> − </mtext><mi>n</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <msup> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mtext> + </mtext><mi>b</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msup> <mtext> </mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>r</mi><mtext> + </mtext><mi>b</mi><mo>−</mo><mtext>1)</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </math>

# Formula Review

*X* ~ *H*(*r*, *b*, *n*) means that the discrete random variable *X* has a hypergeometric probability distribution with *r* = the size of the group of interest (first group), *b* = the size of the second group, and *n* = the size of the chosen sample.

*X* = the number of items from the group of interest that are in the chosen sample, and *X* may take on the values *x* = 0, 1, ..., up to the size of the group of interest. (The minimum value for *X* may be larger than zero in some instances.)

*n* ≤ *r* + *b*

The mean of *X* is given by the formula *μ* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>r</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>r</mi><mtext> + </mtext><mi>b</mi> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>
