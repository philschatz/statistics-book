title: "The Standard Normal Distribution"

---


The **standard normal distribution**{: data-type="term"} is a normal distribution of **standardized values called** ***z*-scores**{: data-type="term"}. **A *z*-score is measured in units of the standard deviation.** For example, if the mean of a normal distribution is five and the standard deviation is two, the value 11 is three standard deviations above (or to the right of) the mean. The calculation is as follows:

*x* = *μ* + (*z*)(*σ*) = 5 + (3)(2) = 11

The *z*-score is three.

The mean for the standard normal distribution is zero, and the standard deviation is one. The transformation *z* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>x</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>μ</mi> </mrow> <mi>σ</mi> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

 produces the distribution *Z* ~ *N*(0, 1). The value *x* comes from a normal distribution with mean *μ* and standard deviation *σ*.

# *Z*-Scores

If *X* is a normally distributed random variable and *X* ~ *N(μ, σ)*, then the *z*-score is:

<div data-type="equation" id="element-521">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mi>z</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mi>x</mi><mtext> </mtext><mo>–</mo><mtext> </mtext><mi>μ</mi> </mrow> <mi>σ</mi> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>
</div>

**The *z*-score tells you how many standard deviations the value *x* is above (to the right of) or below (to the left of) the mean, *μ*.** Values of *x* that are larger than the mean have positive *z*-scores, and values of *x* that are smaller than the mean have negative *z*-scores. If *x* equals the mean, then *x* has a *z*-score of zero.

<div data-type="example" id="element-49" markdown="1">
Suppose *X* ~ *N(5, 6)*. This says that *x* is a normally distributed random variable with mean *μ* = 5 and standard deviation *σ* = 6. Suppose *x* = 17. Then:

<div data-type="equation" id="element-160">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mi>z</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mi>x</mi><mo>–</mo><mi>μ</mi> </mrow> <mi>σ</mi> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mn>17</mn><mo>–</mo><mn>5</mn> </mrow> <mn>6</mn> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mn>2</mn> </mrow> </math>
</div>
This means that *x* = 17 is **two standard deviations** (2*σ*) above or to the right of the mean *μ* = 5. The standard deviation is *σ* = 6.

Notice that: 5 + (2)(6) = 17 (The pattern is *μ* + *zσ* = *x*)

Now suppose *x* = 1. Then: *z* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>x</mi><mo>–</mo><mi>μ</mi> </mrow> <mi>σ</mi> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

 = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mn>1</mn><mo>–</mo><mn>5</mn> </mrow> <mn>6</mn> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

 = –0.67 (rounded to two decimal places)

**This means that *x* = 1 is 0.67 standard deviations (–0.67*σ*) below or to the left of the mean *μ* = 5. Notice that:** 5 + (–0.67)(6) is approximately equal to one (This has the pattern *μ* + (–0.67)σ = 1)

Summarizing, when *z* is positive, *x* is above or to the right of *μ* and when *z* is negative, *x* is to the left of or below *μ*. Or, when *z* is positive, *x* is greater than *μ*, and when *z* is negative *x* is less than *μ*.

Suppose the random variables *X* and *Y* have the following normal distributions: *X* ~ *N*(5, 6) and *Y* ~ *N*(2, 1). If *x* = 17, then *z* = 2. (This was previously shown.) If *y* = 4, what is *z*?

 = 2 where *µ* = 2 and *σ* = 1.

The *z*-score for *y* = 4 is *z* = 2. This means that four is *z* = 2 standard deviations to the right of the mean. Therefore, *x* = 17 and *y* = 4 are both two (of **their own**) standard deviations to the right of **their** respective means.

**The *z*-score allows us to compare data that are scaled differently.** To understand the concept, suppose *X* ~ *N*(5, 6) represents weight gains for one group of people who are trying to gain weight in a six week period and *Y* ~ *N*(2, 1) measures the same weight gain for a second group of people. A negative weight gain would be a weight loss. Since *x* = 17 and *y* = 4 are each two standard deviations to the right of their means, they represent the same, standardized weight gain **relative to their means**.

# Chapter Review

A *z*-score is a standardized value. Its distribution is the standard normal, *Z* ~ *N*(0, 1). The mean of the *z*-scores is zero and the standard deviation is one. If *z* is the *z*-score for a value *x* from the normal distribution *N*(*µ*, *σ*) then *z* tells you how many standard deviations *x* is above (greater than) or below (less than) *µ*.

1.  Use the *z*-score formula. *z* = –0.5141. The height of 77 inches is 0.5141 standard deviations below the mean. An NBA player whose height is 77 inches is short than average.
2.  Use the *z*-score formula. *z* = 1.5424. The height 85 inches is 1.5424 standard deviations above the mean. An NBA player whose height is 85 inches is taller than average.
3.  Height = 79 + 3.5(3.89) = 90.67 inches, which is over 7.7 feet tall. There are very few NBA players this tall so the answer is no, not likely.
