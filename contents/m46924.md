For most of the work you do in this book, you will use a histogram to display the data. One advantage of a histogram is that it can readily display large data sets. A rule of thumb is to use a histogram when the data set consists of 100 values or more.

A **histogram**{: data-type="term"} consists of contiguous (adjoining) boxes. It has both a horizontal axis and a vertical axis. The horizontal axis is labeled with what the data represents (for instance, distance from your home to school). The vertical axis is labeled either **frequency**{: data-type="term"} or **relative frequency**{: data-type="term"} (or percent frequency or probability). The graph will have the same shape with either label. The histogram (like the stemplot) can give you the shape of the data, the center, and the spread of the data.

The relative frequency is equal to the frequency for an observed value of the data divided by the total number of data values in the sample.(Remember, frequency is defined as the number of times an answer occurs.) If:

* *f* = frequency
* *n* = total number of data values (or the sum of the individual frequencies), and
* *RF* = relative frequency,

then: <div data-type="equation" id="element-1000">

For example, if three students in Mr. Ahab\'s English class of 40 students received from 90% to 100%, then, <!--<newline count="1"/>-->*f* = 3, *n* = 40, and *RF* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow><mfrac><mi>f</mi><mi>n</mi></mfrac></mrow></math>

 = 0.075. 7.5% of the students received 90–100%. 90–100% are quantitative measures.

**To construct a histogram**, first decide how many **bars** or **intervals**, also called classes, represent the data. Many histograms consist of five to 15 bars or classes for clarity. The number of bars needs to be chosen. Choose a starting point for the first interval to be less than the smallest data value. A **convenient starting point** is a lower value carried out to one more decimal place than the value with the most decimal places. For example, if the value with the most decimal places is 6.1 and this is the smallest value, a convenient starting point is 6.05 (6.1 – 0.05 = 6.05). We say that 6.05 has more precision. If the value with the most decimal places is 2.23 and the lowest value is 1.5, a convenient starting point is 1.495 (1.5 – 0.005 = 1.495). If the value with the most decimal places is 3.234 and the lowest value is 1.0, a convenient starting point is 0.9995 (1.0 – 0.0005 = 0.9995). If all the data happen to be integers and the smallest value is two, then a convenient starting point is 1.5 (2 – 0.5 = 1.5). Also, when the starting point and other boundaries are carried to one additional decimal place, no data value will fall on a boundary. The next two examples go into detail about how to construct a histogram using continuous data and how to create a histogram using discrete data.

The smallest data value is 60. Since the data with the most decimal places has one decimal (for instance, 61.5), we want our starting point to have two decimal places. Since the numbers 0.5, 0.05, 0.005, etc. are convenient numbers, use 0.05 and subtract it from 60, the smallest value, for the convenient starting point.

60 – 0.05 = 59.95 which is more precise than, say, 61.5 by one decimal place. The starting point is, then, 59.95.

The largest value is 74, so 74 + 0.05 = 74.05 is the ending value.

Next, calculate the width of each bar or class interval. To calculate this width, subtract the starting point from the ending value and divide by the number of bars (you must choose the number of bars you desire). Suppose you choose eight bars.

We will round up to two and make each bar or class interval two units wide. Rounding up to two is one way to prevent a value from falling on a boundary. Rounding to the next number is often necessary even if it goes against the standard rules of rounding. For this example, using 1.76 as the width would also work. A guideline that is followed by some for the width of a bar or class interval is to take the square root of the number of data values and then round to the nearest whole number, if necessary. For example, if there are 150 values of data, take the square root of 150 and round to 12 bars or intervals.

</div>
The boundaries are:

* 59\.95
* 59\.95 + 2 = 61.95
* 61\.95 + 2 = 63.95
* 63\.95 + 2 = 65.95
* 65\.95 + 2 = 67.95
* 67\.95 + 2 = 69.95
* 69\.95 + 2 = 71.95
* 71\.95 + 2 = 73.95
* 73\.95 + 2 = 75.95

The heights 60 through 61.5 inches are in the interval 59.95–61.95. The heights that are 63.5 are in the interval 61.95–63.95. The heights that are 64 through 64.5 are in the interval 63.95–65.95. The heights 66 through 67.5 are in the interval 65.95–67.95. The heights 68 through 69.5 are in the interval 67.95–69.95. The heights 70 through 71 are in the interval 69.95–71.95. The heights 72 through 73.5 are in the interval 71.95–73.95. The height 74 is in the interval 73.95–75.95.

The following histogram displays the heights on the *x*-axis and relative frequency on the *y*-axis.

Eleven students buy one book. Ten students buy two books. Sixteen students buy three books. Six students buy four books. Five students buy five books. Two students buy six books.

Because the data are integers, subtract 0.5 from 1, the smallest data value and add 0.5 to 6, the largest data value. Then the starting point is 0.5 and the ending value is 6.5.

# Frequency Polygons

Frequency polygons are analogous to line graphs, and just as line graphs make continuous data visually easy to interpret, so too do frequency polygons.

To construct a frequency polygon, first examine the data and decide on the number of intervals, or class intervals, to use on the *x*-axis and *y*-axis. After choosing the appropriate ranges, begin plotting the data points. After all the points are plotted, draw line segments to connect them.

The first label on the *x*-axis is 44.5. This represents an interval extending from 39.5 to 49.5. Since the lowest test score is 54.5, this interval is used only to allow the graph to touch the *x*-axis. The point labeled 54.5 represents the next interval, or the first “real” interval from the table, and contains five scores. This reasoning is followed for each of the remaining intervals with the point 104.5 representing the interval from 99.5 to 109.5. Again, this interval contains no data and is only used so that the graph will touch the *x*-axis. Looking at the graph, we say that this distribution is skewed because one side of the graph does not mirror the other side.

Suppose that we want to study the temperature range of a region for an entire month. Every day at noon we note the temperature and write this down in a log. A variety of statistical studies could be done with this data. We could find the mean or the median temperature for the month. We could construct a histogram displaying the number of days that temperatures reach a certain range of values. However, all of these methods ignore a portion of the data that we have collected.

One feature of the data that we may want to consider is that of time. Since each date is paired with the temperature reading for the day, we don‘t have to think of the data as being random. We can instead use the times given to impose a chronological order on the data. A graph that recognizes this ordering and displays the changing temperature as the month progresses is called a time series graph.

# Constructing a Time Series Graph

To construct a time series graph, we must look at both pieces of our **paired data set**{: data-type="term"}. We start with a standard Cartesian coordinate system. The horizontal axis is used to plot the date or time increments, and the vertical axis is used to plot the values of the variable that we are measuring. By doing this, we make each point on the graph correspond to a date and a measured quantity. The points on the graph are typically connected by straight lines in the order in which they occur.

## Uses of a Time Series Graph

Time series graphs are important tools in various applications of statistics. When recording values of the same variable over an extended period of time, sometimes it is difficult to discern any trend or pattern. However, once the same data points are displayed graphically, some features jump out. Time series graphs make trends easy to spot.

# Chapter Review

A **histogram** is a graphic version of a frequency distribution. The graph consists of bars of equal width drawn adjacent to each other. The horizontal scale represents classes of quantitative data values and the vertical scale represents frequencies. The heights of the bars correspond to frequency values. Histograms are typically used for large, continuous, quantitative data sets. A frequency polygon can also be used when graphing large data sets with data points that repeat. The data usually goes on *y*-axis with the frequency being graphed on the *x*-axis. Time series graphs can be helpful when looking at large amounts of data for one variable over a period of time.

1.  Find the relative frequencies for each survey. Write them in the charts.
2.  Using either a graphing calculator, computer, or by hand, use the frequency column to construct a histogram for each publisher's survey. For Publishers A and B, make bar widths of one. For Publisher C, make bar widths of two.
3.  In complete sentences, give two reasons why the graphs for Publishers A and B are not identical.
4.  Would you have expected the graph for Publisher C to look like the other two graphs? Why or why not?
5.  Make new histograms for Publisher A and Publisher B. This time, make bar widths of two.
6.  Now, compare the graph for Publisher C to the new graphs for Publishers A and B. Are the graphs more similar or more different? Explain your answer.

1.  Fill in the relative frequency for each group.
2.  Construct a histogram for the singles group. Scale the *x*-axis by $50 widths. Use relative frequency on the *y*-axis.
3.  Construct a histogram for the couples group. Scale the *x*-axis by $50 widths. Use relative frequency on the *y*-axis.
4.  Compare the two graphs:
    1.  List two similarities between the graphs.
    2.  List two differences between the graphs.
    3.  Overall, are the graphs more similar or different?
    {: data-mark-suffix="." data-number-style="lower-roman"}

5.  Construct a new graph for the couples by hand. Since each couple is paying for two individuals, instead of scaling the *x*-axis by $50, scale it by $100. Use relative frequency on the *y*-axis.
6.  Compare the graph for the singles with the new graph for the couples:
    1.  List two similarities between the graphs.
    2.  Overall, are the graphs more similar or different?
    {: data-mark-suffix="." data-number-style="lower-roman"}

7.  How did scaling the couples graph differently change the way you compared it to the singles graph?
8.  Based on the graphs, do you think that individuals spend the same amount, more or less, as singles as they do person by person as a couple? Explain why in one or two complete sentences.

4.  Compare the two graphs:
    1.  Answers may vary. Possible answers include:
        * Both graphs have a single peak.
        * Both graphs use class intervals with width equal to $50.
    
    2.  Answers may vary. Possible answers include:
        * The couples graph has a class interval with no values.
        * It takes almost twice as many class intervals to display the data for couples.
    
    3.  Answers may vary. Possible answers include: The graphs are more similar than different because the overall patterns for the graphs are the same.
    {: data-mark-suffix="." data-number-style="lower-roman"}

5.  Check student's solution.
6.  Compare the graph for the Singles with the new graph for the Couples:
    1.  * Both graphs have a single peak.
        * Both graphs display 6 class intervals.
        * Both graphs show the same general pattern.
    
    2.  Answers may vary. Possible answers include: Although the width of the class intervals for couples is double that of the class intervals for singles, the graphs are more similar than they are different.
    {: data-mark-suffix="." data-number-style="lower-roman"}

7.  Answers may vary. Possible answers include: You are able to compare the graphs interval by interval. It is easier to compare the overall patterns with the new scale on the Couples graph. Because a couple represents two individuals, the new scale leads to a more accurate comparison.
8.  Answers may vary. Possible answers include: Based on the histograms, it seems that spending does not vary much from singles to individuals who are part of a couple. The overall patterns are the same. The range of spending for couples is approximately double the range for individuals.
