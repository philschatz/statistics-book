Probability is a measure that is associated with how certain we are of outcomes of a particular experiment or activity. An **experiment**{: data-type="term"} is a planned operation carried out under controlled conditions. If the result is not predetermined, then the experiment is said to be a **chance** experiment. Flipping one fair coin twice is an example of an experiment.

A result of an experiment is called an **outcome**{: data-type="term"}. The **sample space**{: data-type="term"} of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes. Three ways to represent a sample space are: to list the possible outcomes, to create a tree diagram, or to create a Venn diagram. The uppercase letter *S* is used to denote the sample space. For example, if you flip one fair coin, *S* = \{*H*, *T*} where *H* = heads and *T* = tails are the outcomes.

An **event**{: data-type="term"} is any combination of outcomes. Upper case letters like *A* and *B* represent events. For example, if the experiment is to flip one fair coin, event *A* might be getting at most one head. The probability of an event *A* is written *P*(*A*).

The **probability**{: data-type="term"} of any outcome is the **long-term relative frequency**{: data-type="term"} of that outcome. **Probabilities are between zero and one, inclusive** (that is, zero and one and all numbers between these values). *P*(*A*) = 0 means the event *A* can never happen. *P*(*A*) = 1 means the event *A* always happens. *P*(*A*) = 0.5 means the event *A* is equally likely to occur or not to occur. For example, if you flip one fair coin repeatedly (from 20 to 2,000 to 20,000 times) the relative frequency of heads approaches 0.5 (the probability of heads).

**Equally likely**{: data-type="term"} means that each outcome of an experiment occurs with equal probability. For example, if you toss a **fair**{: data-type="term"}, six-sided die, each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) is as likely to occur as any other face. If you toss a fair coin, a Head (*H*) and a Tail (*T*) are equally likely to occur. If you randomly guess the answer to a true/false question on an exam, you are equally likely to select a correct answer or an incorrect answer.

**To calculate the probability of an event *A* when all outcomes in the sample space are equally likely**, count the number of outcomes for event *A* and divide by the total number of outcomes in the sample space. For example, if you toss a fair dime and a fair nickel, the sample space is \{*HH*, *TH*, *HT*, *TT*} where *T* = tails and *H* = heads. The sample space has four outcomes. *A* = getting one head. There are two outcomes that meet this condition \{*HT*, *TH*}, so *P*(*A*) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>2</mn> <mn>4</mn> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

 = 0.5.

Suppose you roll one fair six-sided die, with the numbers \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} on its faces. Let event *E* = rolling a number that is at least five. There are two outcomes \{5, 6}. *P*(*E*) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>2</mn> <mn>6</mn> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

. If you were to roll the die only a few times, you would not be surprised if your observed results did not match the probability. If you were to roll the die a very large number of times, you would expect that, overall, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>

 of the rolls would result in an outcome of \"at least five\". You would not expect exactly <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>

. The long-term relative frequency of obtaining this result would approach the theoretical probability of <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>

 as the number of repetitions grows larger and larger.

This important characteristic of probability experiments is known as the **law of large numbers**{: data-type="term"} which states that as the number of repetitions of an experiment is increased, the relative frequency obtained in the experiment tends to become closer and closer to the theoretical probability. Even though the outcomes do not happen according to any set pattern or order, overall, the long-term observed relative frequency will approach the theoretical probability. (The word **empirical** is often used instead of the word observed.)

It is important to realize that in many situations, the outcomes are not equally likely. A coin or die may be **unfair**{: data-type="term"}, or **biased**. Two math professors in Europe had their statistics students test the Belgian one Euro coin and discovered that in 250 trials, a head was obtained 56% of the time and a tail was obtained 44% of the time. The data seem to show that the coin is not a fair coin; more repetitions would be helpful to draw a more accurate conclusion about such bias. Some dice may be biased. Look at the dice in a game you have at home; the spots on each face are usually small holes carved out and then painted to make the spots visible. Your dice may or may not be biased; it is possible that the outcomes may be affected by the slight weight differences due to the different numbers of holes in the faces. Gambling casinos make a lot of money depending on outcomes from rolling dice, so casino dice are made differently to eliminate bias. Casino dice have flat faces; the holes are completely filled with paint having the same density as the material that the dice are made out of so that each face is equally likely to occur. Later we will learn techniques to use to work with probabilities for events that are not equally likely.* * *

<span data-type="title">\"OR\" Event:</span>An outcome is in the event *A* OR *B* if the outcome is in *A* or is in *B* or is in both *A* and *B*. For example, let *A* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and *B* = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. *A* OR *B* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. Notice that 4 and 5 are NOT listed twice.* * *
{: data-type="newline" data-count="2"}

<span data-type="title">\"AND\" Event:</span>An outcome is in the event *A* AND *B* if the outcome is in both *A* and *B* at the same time. For example, let *A* and *B* be \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, respectively. Then *A* AND *B* = \{4, 5}.

The **complement**{: data-type="term"} of event *A* is denoted *A′* (read \"*A* prime\"). *A′* consists of all outcomes that are **NOT** in *A*. Notice that *P*(*A*) + *P*(*A′*) = 1. For example, let *S* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} and let *A* = \{1, 2, 3, 4}. Then, *A′* = \{5, 6}. *P*(*A*) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>4</mn><mn>6</mn></mfrac></mrow></math>

The **conditional probability**{: data-type="term"} of *A* given *B* is written *P*(*A*\\\|*B*). *P*(*A*\\\|*B*) is the probability that event *A* will occur given that the event *B* has already occurred. **A conditional reduces the sample space**. We calculate the probability of *A* from the reduced sample space *B*. The formula to calculate *P*(*A*\\\|*B*) is *P*(*A*\\\|*B*) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mtext> AND </mtext><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

 where *P*(*B*) is greater than zero.

For example, suppose we toss one fair, six-sided die. The sample space *S* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. Let *A* = face is 2 or 3 and *B* = face is even (2, 4, 6). To calculate *P*(*A*\\\|*B*), we count the number of outcomes 2 or 3 in the sample space *B* = \{2, 4, 6}. Then we divide that by the number of outcomes *B* (rather than *S*).

We get the same result by using the formula. Remember that *S* has six outcomes.

*P*(*A*\\\|*B*) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>A</mi><mspace width="2pt" /><mtext>AND</mtext><mspace width="2pt" /><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>P</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>B</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>the number of outcomes that are 2 or 3 and even in </mtext><mspace width="2pt" /><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mn>6</mn> </mfrac> </mrow> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mtext>the number of outcomes that are even in </mtext><mspace width="2pt" /><mi>S</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mn>6</mn> </mfrac> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>1</mn> <mn>6</mn> </mfrac> </mrow> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>3</mn> <mn>6</mn> </mfrac> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mn>1</mn> <mn>3</mn> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

<span data-type="title">Understanding Terminology and Symbols</span>It is important to read each problem carefully to think about and understand what the events are. Understanding the wording is the first very important step in solving probability problems. Reread the problem several times if necessary. Clearly identify the event of interest. Determine whether there is a condition stated in the wording that would indicate that the probability is conditional; carefully identify the condition, if any.

### Chapter Review

In this module we learned the basic terminology of probability. The set of all possible outcomes of an experiment is called the sample space. Events are subsets of the sample space, and they are assigned a probability that is a number between zero and one, inclusive.

2.  Describe in words what the entry 40 means.
3.  Describe in words the complement of the entry in question 2.
4.  Describe in words what the entry 30 means.
5.  Out of the males and females, what percent are males?
6.  Out of the females, what percent disapprove of Mayor Ford?

1.  You can't calculate the joint probability knowing the probability of both events occurring, which is not in the information given; the probabilities should be multiplied, not added; and probability is never greater than 100%
2.  A home run by definition is a successful hit, so he has to have at least as many successful hits as home runs.

### Glossary
{: data-type="glossary-title"}

Conditional Probability
: {: #id3663808} the likelihood that an event will occur given that another event has already occurred
{: #condprob}

Equally Likely
: {: #id3651637} Each outcome of an experiment has the same probability.
{: #eqlikly}

Event
: {: #id19906185} a subset of the set of all outcomes of an experiment; the set of all outcomes of an experiment is called a **sample space** and is usually denoted by *S*. An event is an arbitrary subset in *S*. It can contain one outcome, two outcomes, no outcomes (empty subset), the entire sample space, and the like. Standard notations for events are capital letters such as *A*, *B*, *C*, and so on.
{: #event}

Experiment
: {: #id3579725} a planned activity carried out under controlled conditions
{: #experiment}

Outcome
: {: #id3610906} a particular result of an experiment
{: #outcome}

Probability
: {: #id17934331} a number between zero and one, inclusive, that gives the likelihood that a specific event will occur; the foundation of statistics is given by the following 3 axioms (by A.N. Kolmogorov, 1930’s): Let *S* denote the sample space and *A* and *B* are two events in *S*. Then:
  * 0 ≤ *P*(*A*) ≤ 1
  * If *A* and *B* are any two mutually exclusive events, then *P*(*A* OR *B*) = *P*(*A*) + *P*(B).
  * *P*(*S*) = 1
{: #prob}

Sample Space
: {: #id3455189} the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment
{: #samplesp}

The AND Event
: An outcome is in the event *A* AND *B* if the outcome is in both *A* AND *B* at the same time.
^

The Complement Event
: The complement of event *A* consists of all outcomes that are NOT in *A*.
^

The Conditional Probability of *A* GIVEN *B*
: *P*(*A*\\\|*B*) is the probability that event *A* will occur given that the event *B* has already occurred.
^

The Or Event
: An outcome is in the event *A* OR *B* if the outcome is in *A* or is in *B* or is in both *A* and *B*.
