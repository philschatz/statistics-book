* In a **hypothesis test**{: data-type="term"} problem, you may see words such as \"the level of significance is 1%.\" The \"1%\" is the preconceived or preset *α*.
* The statistician setting up the hypothesis test selects the value of *α* to use **before** collecting the sample data.
* **If no level of significance is given, a common standard to use is *α* = 0.05.**
* When you calculate the *p*-value and draw the picture, the *p*-value is the area in the left tail, the right tail, or split evenly between the two tails. For this reason, we call the hypothesis test left, right, or two tailed.
* The **alternative hypothesis**,
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>H</mi><mi>a</mi></msub></math>
  
  , tells you if the test is left, right, or two-tailed. It is the **key** to conducting the appropriate test.
* *H<sub>a</sub>* **never** has a symbol that contains an equal sign.
* **Thinking about the meaning of the** ***p*-value**{: data-type="term"}\: A data analyst (and anyone else) should have more confidence that he made the correct decision to reject the null hypothesis with a smaller *p*-value (for example, 0.001 as opposed to 0.04) even if using the 0.05 level for alpha. Similarly, for a large *p*-value such as 0.4, as opposed to a *p*-value of 0.056 (alpha = 0.05 is less than either number), a data analyst should have more confidence that she made the correct decision in not rejecting the null hypothesis. This makes the data analyst use judgment rather than mindlessly applying rules.

The following examples illustrate a left-, right-, and two-tailed test.

Jeffrey, as an eight-year old, **established a mean time of 16.43 seconds** for swimming the 25-yard freestyle, with a **standard deviation of 0.8 seconds**. His dad, Frank, thought that Jeffrey could swim the 25-yard freestyle faster using goggles. Frank bought Jeffrey a new pair of expensive goggles and timed Jeffrey for **15 25-yard freestyle swims**. For the 15 swims, **Jeffrey's mean time was 16 seconds. Frank thought that the goggles helped Jeffrey to swim faster than the 16.43 seconds.** Conduct a hypothesis test using a preset *α* = 0.05. Assume that the swim times for the 25-yard freestyle are normal.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="id5036614" markdown="1">
Set up the Hypothesis Test:

Since the problem is about a mean, this is a **test of a single population mean**.

*H<sub>0</sub>*: *μ* = 16.43  *H<sub>a</sub>*: *μ* &lt; 16.43

For Jeffrey to swim faster, his time will be less than 16.43 seconds. The "&lt;" tells you this is left-tailed.

Determine the distribution needed:

<strong>Random variable: </strong><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><apply><conjugate /><mi>X</mi></apply></math>

 = the mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle.

<strong> Distribution for the test: </strong> <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><apply><conjugate /><mi>X</mi></apply></math>

 is normal (population **standard deviation**{: data-type="term"} is known: *σ* = 0.8)

*μ* = 16.43 comes from *H<sub>0</sub>* and not the data. *σ* = 0.8, and *n* = 15.

Calculate the *p*-value using the normal distribution for a mean:

*p*-value = *P*(<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> </math>

 &lt; 16) = 0.0187 where the sample mean in the problem is given as 16.

*p*-value = 0.0187 (This is called the **actual level of significance**.) The *p*-value is the area to the left of the sample mean is given as 16.

**Graph:**

![Normal distribution curve for the average time to swim the 25-yard freestyle with values 16, as the sample mean, and 16.43 on the x-axis. A vertical upward line extends from 16 on the x-axis to the curve. An arrow points to the left tail of the curve.](../resources/fig-ch09_11_01N.jpg){: #hyptest11_ex1}


*μ* = 16.43 comes from *H<sub>0</sub>*. Our assumption is *μ* = 16.43.

**Interpretation of the *p*-value: If *H<sub>0</sub>* is true**, there is a 0.0187 probability (1.87%)that Jeffrey's mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle is 16 seconds or less. Because a 1.87% chance is small, the mean time of 16 seconds or less is unlikely to have happened randomly. It is a rare event.

Compare *α* and the *p*-value:

*α* = 0.05 *p*-value = 0.0187 *α* &gt; *p*-value

**Make a decision:** Since *α* &gt; *p*-value, reject *H<sub>0</sub>*.

<!-- CONTINUE HERE -->

This means that you reject *μ* = 16.43. In other words, you do not think Jeffrey swims the 25-yard freestyle in 16.43 seconds but faster with the new goggles.

**Conclusion:** At the 5% significance level, we conclude that Jeffrey swims faster using the new goggles. The sample data show there is sufficient evidence that Jeffrey's mean time to swim the 25-yard freestyle is less than 16.43 seconds.

The *p*-value can easily be calculated.

The Type I and Type II errors for this problem are as follows:

The Type I error is to conclude that Jeffrey swims the 25-yard freestyle, on average, in less than 16.43 seconds when, in fact, he actually swims the 25-yard freestyle, on average, in 16.43 seconds. (Reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true.)

The Type II error is that there is not evidence to conclude that Jeffrey swims the 25-yard free-style, on average, in less than 16.43 seconds when, in fact, he actually does swim the 25-yard free-style, on average, in less than 16.43 seconds. (Do not reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.)

The mean throwing distance of a football for a Marco, a high school freshman quarterback, is 40 yards, with a standard deviation of two yards. The team coach tells Marco to adjust his grip to get more distance. The coach records the distances for 20 throws. For the 20 throws, Marco’s mean distance was 45 yards. The coach thought the different grip helped Marco throw farther than 40 yards. Conduct a hypothesis test using a preset *α* = 0.05. Assume the throw distances for footballs are normal.

First, determine what type of test this is, set up the hypothesis test, find the *p*-value, sketch the graph, and state your conclusion.

The traditional way to compare the two probabilities, *α* and the *p*-value, is to compare the critical value (*z*-score from *α*) to the test statistic (*z*-score from data). The calculated test statistic for the *p*-value is –2.08.

You can find the critical value for *α* = 0.05 in the normal table (see **15.Tables** in the Table of Contents). The *z*-score for an area to the left equal to 0.05 is midway between –1.65 and –1.64 (0.05 is midway between 0.0505 and 0.0495). The *z*-score is –1.645. Since –1.645 &gt; –2.08 (which demonstrates that α &gt; *p*-value), reject *H<sub>0</sub>*. Traditionally, the decision to reject or not reject was done in this way. Today, comparing the two probabilities *α* and the *p*-value is very common. For this problem, the *p*-value, 0.0187 is considerably smaller than *α*, 0.05. You can be confident about your decision to reject. The graph shows *α*, the *p*-value, and the test statistics and the critical value.

Since *α* = 0.05 and *p*-value = 0.0396. *α* &gt; *p*-value.

**Make a decision:** Since *α* &gt; *p*-value, reject *H<sub>0</sub>*.

This means you reject *μ* = 65. In other words, you believe the average test score is more than 65.

**Conclusion:** At a 5% level of significance, the sample data show sufficient evidence that the mean (average) test score is more than 65, just as the math instructor thinks.

The *p*-value can easily be calculated.

Joon believes that 50% of first-time brides in the United States are younger than their grooms. She performs a hypothesis test to determine if the percentage is **the same or different from 50%**. Joon samples **100 first-time brides** and **53** reply that they are younger than their grooms. For the hypothesis test, she uses a 1% level of significance.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="id4150001" markdown="1">
Set up the hypothesis test:

The 1% level of significance means that *α* = 0.01. This is a **test of a single population proportion**.

*H<sub>0</sub>*: *p* = 0.50  *H<sub>a</sub>*: *p* ≠ 0.50

The words **"is the same or different from"** tell you this is a two-tailed test.

Calculate the distribution needed:

**Random variable:** *P′* = the percent of of first-time brides who are younger than their grooms.

**Distribution for the test:** The problem contains no mention of a mean. The information is given in terms of percentages. Use the distribution for *P′*, the estimated proportion.

where *p* = 0.50, *q* = 1−*p* = 0.50, and *n* = 100

Calculate the *p*-value using the normal distribution for proportions:

*p*-value = *P* (*p′* &lt; 0.47 or *p′* &gt; 0.53) = 0.5485

where *x* = 53, *p′* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mi>x</mi> <mi>n</mi> </mfrac> <mtext> = </mtext><mfrac> <mrow> <mtext>53</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>100</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

 = 0.53.

**Interpretation of the *p*-value:** If the null hypothesis is true, there is 0.5485 probability (54.85%) that the sample (estimated) proportion <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>p</mi><mo>'</mo></math>

 is 0.53 or more OR 0.47 or less (see the graph in [[link]](#hyptest11_ex5)).

*μ* = *p* = 0.50 comes from *H<sub>0</sub>*, the null hypothesis.

*p′* = 0.53. Since the curve is symmetrical and the test is two-tailed, the *p′* for the left tail is equal to 0.50 – 0.03 = 0.47 where *μ* = *p* = 0.50. (0.03 is the difference between 0.53 and 0.50.)

Compare *α* and the *p*-value:

Since *α* = 0.01 and *p*-value = 0.5485. *α* &lt; *p*-value.

**Make a decision:** Since *α* &lt; *p*-value, you cannot reject *H<sub>0</sub>*.

**Conclusion:** At the 1% level of significance, the sample data do not show sufficient evidence that the percentage of first-time brides who are younger than their grooms is different from 50%.

The *p*-value can easily be calculated.

The Type I and Type II errors are as follows:

The Type I error is to conclude that the proportion of first-time brides who are younger than their grooms is different from 50% when, in fact, the proportion is actually 50%. (Reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true).

The Type II error is there is not enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of first time brides who are younger than their grooms differs from 50% when, in fact, the proportion does differ from 50%. (Do not reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false.)

The next example is a poem written by a statistics student named Nicole Hart. The solution to the problem follows the poem. Notice that the hypothesis test is for a single population proportion. This means that the null and alternate hypotheses use the parameter *p*. The distribution for the test is normal. The estimated proportion *p*′ is the proportion of fleas killed to the total fleas found on Fido. This is sample information. The problem gives a preconceived *α* = 0.01, for comparison, and a 95% confidence interval computation. The poem is clever and humorous, so please enjoy it!

    2.  *H<sub>a</sub>*: *p* &gt; 0.00034
    {: data-number-style="lower-alpha"}
    
    If we commit a Type I error, we are essentially accepting a false claim. Since the claim describes cancer-causing environments, we want to minimize the chances of incorrectly identifying causes of cancer.
    {: .finger}

2.  We will be testing a sample proportion with *x* = 172 and *n* = 420,019. The sample is sufficiently large because we have *np* = 420,019(0.00034) = 142.8, *nq* = 420,019(0.99966) = 419,876.2, two independent outcomes, and a fixed probability of success *p* = 0.00034. Thus we will be able to generalize our results to the population.

4.  Since the *p*-value = 0.0073 is greater than our alpha value = 0.005, we cannot reject the null. Therefore, we conclude that there is not enough evidence to support the claim of higher brain cancer rates for the cell phone users.

According to the US Census there are approximately 268,608,618 residents aged 12 and older. Statistics from the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network indicate that, on average, 207,754 rapes occur each year (male and female) for persons aged 12 and older. This translates into a percentage of sexual assaults of 0.078%. In Daviess County, KY, there were reported 11 rapes for a population of 37,937. Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the local sexual assault percentage and the national sexual assault percentage. Use a significance level of 0.01.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" class="solution" id="eip-659" markdown="1">
We will follow the four-step plan.

1.  We need to test whether the proportion of sexual assaults in Daviess County, KY is significantly different from the national average.
2.  Since we are presented with proportions, we will use a one-proportion *z*-test. The hypotheses for the test will be
    1.  *H<sub>0</sub>*: *p* = 0.00078
    2.  *H<sub>a</sub>*: *p* ≠ 0.00078

4.  Since the *p*-value, *p* = 0.00063, is less than the alpha level of 0.01, the sample data indicates that we should reject the null hypothesis. In conclusion, the sample data support the claim that the proportion of sexual assaults in Daviess County, Kentucky is different from the national average proportion.

# Chapter Review

The **hypothesis test**{: data-type="term"} itself has an established process. This can be summarized as follows: <div data-type="list" data-list-type="enumerated" id="list-1">
<div data-type="item">
Determine *H<sub>0</sub>* and *H<sub>a</sub>*. Remember, they are contradictory.
</div>
<div data-type="item">
Determine the random variable.
</div>
<div data-type="item">
Determine the distribution for the test.
</div>
<div data-type="item">
Draw a graph, calculate the test statistic, and use the test statistic to calculate the *p*-value. (A *z*-score and a *t*-score are examples of test statistics.)
</div>
<div data-type="item">
Compare the preconceived *α* with the *p*-value, make a decision (reject or do not reject *H<sub>0</sub>*), and write a clear conclusion using English sentences.
</div>
</div>

Notice that in performing the hypothesis test, you use *α* and not *β*. *β* is needed to help determine the sample size of the data that is used in calculating the *p*-value. Remember that the quantity 1 – *β* is called the **Power of the Test**. A high power is desirable. If the power is too low, statisticians typically increase the sample size while keeping *α* the same.If the power is low, the null hypothesis might not be rejected when it should be.

A particular brand of tires claims that its deluxe tire averages at least 50,000 miles before it needs to be replaced. From past studies of this tire, the standard deviation is known to be 8,000.

"Asian Family Reunion," by Chau Nguyen

Every two years it comes around.

We all get together from different towns.

In my honest opinion,

It's not a typical family reunion.

Not forty, or fifty, or sixty,

But how about seventy companions!

The kids would play, scream, and shout

One minute they're happy, another they'll pout.

The teenagers would look, stare, and compare

From how they look to what they wear.

The men would chat about their business

That they make more, but never less.

Money is always their subject

And there's always talk of more new projects.

The women get tired from all of the chats

They head to the kitchen to set out the mats.

Some would sit and some would stand

Eating and talking with plates in their hands.

Then come the games and the songs

And suddenly, everyone gets along!

With all that laughter, it's sad to say

That it always ends in the same old way.

They hug and kiss and say "good-bye"

And then they all begin to cry!

I say that 60 percent shed their tears

But my mom counted 35 people this year.

She said that boys and men will always have their pride,

So we won't ever see them cry.

I myself don't think she's correct,

So could you please try this problem to see if you object?

"Macaroni and Cheese, please!!" by Nedda Misherghi and Rachelle Hall

As a poor starving student I don't have much money to spend for even the bare necessities. So my favorite and main staple food is macaroni and cheese. It's high in taste and low in cost and nutritional value.

One day, as I sat down to determine the meaning of life, I got a serious craving for this, oh, so important, food of my life. So I went down the street to Greatway to get a box of macaroni and cheese, but it was SO expensive! $2.02 !!! Can you believe it? It made me stop and think. The world is changing fast. I had thought that the mean cost of a box (the normal size, not some super-gigantic-family-value-pack) was at most $1, but now I wasn't so sure. However, I was determined to find out. I went to 53 of the closest grocery stores and surveyed the prices of macaroni and cheese. Here are the data I wrote in my notebook:

<div data-type="list" id="element-357" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Price per box of Mac and Cheese:
</div>
* 5 stores @ $2.02
* 15 stores @ $0.25

* 6 stores @ $0.35
* 4 stores @ $2.27
* 7 stores @ $1.50
* 5 stores @ $1.89
* 8 stores @ 0.75.

</div>
I could see that the cost varied but I had to sit down to figure out whether or not I was right. If it does turn out that this mouth-watering dish is at most $1, then I'll throw a big cheesy party in our next statistics lab, with enough macaroni and cheese for just me. (After all, as a poor starving student I can't be expected to feed our class of animals!)

<div data-type="title">
THE CHARACTERS (in order of appearance):
</div>
* HAMLET, Prince of Denmark and student of Statistics
* POLONIUS, Hamlet’s tutor
* HOROTIO, friend to Hamlet and fellow student

</div>
Scene: The great library of the castle, in which Hamlet does his lessons

Act I

(The day is fair, but the face of Hamlet is clouded. He paces the large room. His tutor, Polonius, is reprimanding Hamlet regarding the latter’s recent experience. Horatio is seated at the large table at right stage.)

POLONIUS: My Lord, how cans’t thou admit that thou hast seen a ghost! It is but a figment of your imagination!

HAMLET: I beg to differ; I know of a certainty that five-and-seventy in one hundred of us, condemned to the whips and scorns of time as we are, have gazed upon a spirit of health, or goblin damn’d, be their intents wicked or charitable.

POLONIUS If thou doest insist upon thy wretched vision then let me invest your time; be true to thy work and speak to me through the reason of the null and alternate hypotheses. (He turns to Horatio.) Did not Hamlet himself say, “What piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties? Then let not this foolishness persist. Go, Horatio, make a survey of three-and-sixty and discover what the true proportion be. For my part, I will never succumb to this fantasy, but deem man to be devoid of all reason should thy proposal of at least five-and-seventy in one hundred hold true.

HORATIO (to Hamlet): What should we do, my Lord?

HAMLET: Go to thy purpose, Horatio.

HORATIO: To what end, my Lord?

HAMLET: That you must teach me. But let me conjure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonance of our youth, but the obligation of our ever-preserved love, be even and direct with me, whether I am right or no.

(Horatio exits, followed by Polonius, leaving Hamlet to ponder alone.)

Act II

(The next day, Hamlet awaits anxiously the presence of his friend, Horatio. Polonius enters and places some books upon the table just a moment before Horatio enters.)

POLONIUS: So, Horatio, what is it thou didst reveal through thy deliberations?

HORATIO: In a random survey, for which purpose thou thyself sent me forth, I did discover that one-and-forty believe fervently that the spirits of the dead walk with us. Before my God, I might not this believe, without the sensible and true avouch of mine own eyes.

POLONIUS: Give thine own thoughts no tongue, Horatio. (Polonius turns to Hamlet.) But look to’t I charge you, my Lord. Come Horatio, let us go together, for this is not our test. (Horatio and Polonius leave together.)

HAMLET: To reject, or not reject, that is the question: whether ‘tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous statistics, or to take arms against a sea of data, and, by opposing, end them. (Hamlet resignedly attends to his task.)

(Curtain falls)

"Untitled," by Stephen Chen

I've often wondered how software is released and sold to the public. Ironically, I work for a company that sells products with known problems. Unfortunately, most of the problems are difficult to create, which makes them difficult to fix. I usually use the test program X, which tests the product, to try to create a specific problem. When the test program is run to make an error occur, the likelihood of generating an error is 1%.

So, armed with this knowledge, I wrote a new test program Y that will generate the same error that test program X creates, but more often. To find out if my test program is better than the original, so that I can convince the management that I'm right, I ran my test program to find out how often I can generate the same error. When I ran my test program 50 times, I generated the error twice. While this may not seem much better, I think that I can convince the management to use my test program instead of the original test program. Am I right?

"Japanese Girls’ Names"

by Kumi Furuichi

It used to be very typical for Japanese girls’ names to end with “ko.” (The trend might have started around my grandmothers’ generation and its peak might have been around my mother’s generation.) “Ko” means “child” in Chinese characters. Parents would name their daughters with “ko” attaching to other Chinese characters which have meanings that they want their daughters to become, such as Sachiko—happy child, Yoshiko—a good child, Yasuko—a healthy child, and so on.

However, I noticed recently that only two out of nine of my Japanese girlfriends at this school have names which end with “ko.” More and more, parents seem to have become creative, modernized, and, sometimes, westernized in naming their children.

I have a feeling that, while 70 percent or more of my mother’s generation would have names with “ko” at the end, the proportion has dropped among my peers. I wrote down all my Japanese friends’, ex-classmates’, co-workers, and acquaintances’ names that I could remember. Following are the names. (Some are repeats.) Test to see if the proportion has dropped for this generation.

"Phillip’s Wish," by Suzanne Osorio

My nephew likes to play

Chasing the girls makes his day.

He asked his mother

If it is okay

To get his ear pierced.

She said, “No way!”

To poke a hole through your ear,

Is not what I want for you, dear.

He argued his point quite well,

Says even my macho pal, Mel,

Has gotten this done.

It’s all just for fun.

C’mon please, mom, please, what the hell.

Again Phillip complained to his mother,

Saying half his friends (including their brothers)

Are piercing their ears

And they have no fears

He wants to be like the others.

She said, “I think it’s much less.

We must do a hypothesis test.

And if you are right,

I won’t put up a fight.

But, if not, then my case will rest.”

We proceeded to call fifty guys

To see whose prediction would fly.

Nineteen of the fifty

Said piercing was nifty

And earrings they’d occasionally buy.

Then there’s the other thirty-one,

Who said they’d never have this done.

So now this poem’s finished.

Will his hopes be diminished,

Or will my nephew have his fun?

La Leche League International reports that the mean age of weaning a child from breastfeeding is age four to five worldwide. In America, most nursing mothers wean their children much earlier. Suppose a random survey is conducted of 21 U.S. mothers who recently weaned their children. The mean weaning age was nine months (3/4 year) with a standard deviation of 4 months. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the mean weaning age in the U.S. is less than four years old.

Over the past few decades, public health officials have examined the link between weight concerns and teen girls' smoking. Researchers surveyed a group of 273 randomly selected teen girls living in Massachusetts (between 12 and 15 years old). After four years the girls were surveyed again. Sixty-three said they smoked to stay thin. Is there good evidence that more than thirty percent of the teen girls smoke to stay thin?* * *

After conducting the test, your decision and conclusion are

1.  Reject *H<sub>0</sub>*: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that more than 30% of teen girls smoke to stay thin.
2.  Do not reject *H<sub>0</sub>*: There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that less than 30% of teen girls smoke to stay thin.

According to the Center for Disease Control website, in 2011 at least 18% of high school students have smoked a cigarette. An Introduction to Statistics class in Davies County, KY conducted a hypothesis test at the local high school (a medium sized–approximately 1,200 students–small city demographic) to determine if the local high school’s percentage was lower. One hundred fifty students were chosen at random and surveyed. Of the 150 students surveyed, 82 have smoked. Use a significance level of 0.05 and using appropriate statistical evidence, conduct a hypothesis test and state the conclusions.
