Do you think that those who participate in this poll are representative of all football fans in America?

**17**. Two researchers studying vaccination rates independently draw samples of 50 children, ages 3–18 months, from a large urban area, and determine if they are up to date on their vaccinations. One researcher finds that 84 percent of the children in her sample are up to date, and the other finds that 86 percent in his sample are up to date. Assuming both followed proper sampling procedures and did their calculations correctly, what is a likely explanation for this discrepancy?

**18**. A high school increased the length of the school day from 6.5 to 7.5 hours. Students who wished to attend this high school were required to sign contracts pledging to put forth their best effort on their school work and to obey the school rules; if they did not wish to do so, they could attend another high school in the district. At the end of one year, student performance on statewide tests had increased by ten percentage points over the previous year. Does this improvement prove that a longer school day improves student achievement?

**19**. You read a newspaper article reporting that eating almonds leads to increased life satisfaction.

**12**. Answers will vary. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

Sample Answer: One possibility is to obtain the class roster and assign each student a number from 1 to 200. Then use a random number generator or table of random number to generate 30 numbers between 1 and 200, and select the students matching the random numbers. It would also be acceptable to write each student’s name on a card, shuffle them in a box, and draw 30 names at random.

**13**. One possibility would be to obtain a roster of students enrolled in the college, including the class standing for each student. Then you would draw a proportionate random sample from within each class (for instance, if 30 percent of the students in the college are freshman, then 30 percent of your sample would be drawn from the freshman class).

**14**. For the first person picked, the chance of any individual being selected is one in 150. For the second person, it is one in 149, for the third it is one in 148, and so on. For the 30th person selected, the chance of selection is one in 121.

**15**. a

**16**. No. There are at least two chances for bias. First, the viewers of this particular program may not be representative of American football fans as a whole. Second, the sample will be self-selected, because people have to make a phone call in order to take part, and those people are probably not representative of the American football fan population as a whole.

**17**. These results (84 percent in one sample, 86 percent in the other) are probably due to sampling variability. Each researcher drew a different sample of children, and you would not expect them to get exactly the same result, although you would expect the results to be similar, as they are in this case.

**18**. No. The improvement could also be due to self-selection: only motivated students were willing to sign the contract, and they would have done well even in a school with 6.5 hour days. Because both changes were implemented at the same time, it is not possible to separate out their influence.

**19**. At least two aspects of this poll are troublesome. The first is that it was conducted by a group who would benefit by the result—almond sales are likely to increase if people believe that eating almonds will make them happier. The second is that this poll found that almond consumption and life satisfaction are correlated, but does not establish that eating almonds causes satisfaction. It is equally possible, for instance, that people with higher incomes are more likely to eat almonds, and are also more satisfied with their lives.

**20**. You want the sample of people who take part in a survey to be representative of the population from which they are drawn. People who refuse to take part in a survey often have different views than those who do participate, and so even a random sample may produce biased results if a large percentage of those selected refuse to participate in a survey.

**21**. 13.2

#### 1.4: Experimental Design and Ethics   {#eip-id4268574}

**22**.

1.  population: all college students
2.  sample: the 100 college students in the study
3.  experimental units: each individual college student who participated
4.  explanatory variable: the size of the tableware
5.  treatment: tableware that is 20 percent smaller than normal
6.  response variable: the amount of food eaten
{: type="a"}

**23**. There are many lurking variables that could influence the observed differences in test scores. Perhaps the boys, on average, have taken more math courses than the girls, and the girls have taken more English classes than the boys. Perhaps the boys have been encouraged by their families and teachers to prepare for a career in math and science, and thus have put more effort into studying math, while the girls have been encouraged to prepare for fields like communication and psychology that are more focused on language use. A study design would have to control for these and other potential lurking variables (anything that could explain the observed difference in test scores, other than the genetic explanation) in order to draw a scientifically sound conclusion about genetic differences.

**24**. To use random assignment, you would have to be able to assign people to either smoke or not smoke. Because smoking has many harmful effects, this would not be an ethical experiment. Instead, we study people who have chosen to smoke, and compare them to others who have chosen not to smoke, and try to control for the other ways those two groups may differ (lurking variables).

**25**. Sources of bias include the fact that not everyone has a telephone, that cell phone numbers are often not listed in published directories, and that an individual might not be at home at the time of the phone call; all these factors make it likely that the respondents to the survey will not be representative of the population as a whole.

**26**. Research subjects should not be coerced into participation, and offering extra credit in exchange for participation could be construed as coercion. In addition, this method will result in a volunteer sample, which cannot be assumed to be representative of the population as a whole.

#### 2.1: Stem-and Leaf Graphs (Stemplots), Line Graphs, and Bar Graphs   {#eip-id1168064965406}

**27**. The value 740 is an outlier, because the exams were graded on a scale of 0 to 100, and 740 is far outside that range. It may be a data entry error, with the actual score being 74, so the professor should check that exam again to see what the actual score was.

**28**.

**33**. The bar from 3.5 to 4.5, with a central point of 4, will be tallest; its height will be nine, because there are nine students taking four courses.

**34**. The histogram is a better choice, because income is a continuous variable.

**35**. A bar graph is the better choice, because this data is categorical rather than continuous.

#### 2.3: Measures of the Location of the Data   {#eip-196}

**36**. Your daughter scored better than 80 percent of the students in her grade on math and better than 76 percent of the students in reading. Both scores are very good, and place her in the upper quartile, but her math score is slightly better in relation to her peers than her reading score.

**37**. You had an unusually long wait time, which is bad: 82 percent of patients had a shorter wait time than you, and only 18 percent had a longer wait time.

**45**. Half the runners who finished the marathon ran a time faster than 3:35:04, and half ran a time slower than 3:35:04. Your time is faster than the median time, so you did better than more than half of the runners in this race.

**46**. 61.5, or $61,500

#### 7.3: Using the Central Limit Theorem

**88**. What does the law of large numbers say about the relationship between the sample mean and the population mean?

**89**. Applying the law of large numbers, which sample mean would expect to be closer to the population mean, a sample of size ten or a sample of size 100?

*Use this information for the next three questions.* A manufacturer makes screws with a mean diameter of 0.15 cm (centimeters) and a range of 0.10 cm to 0.20 cm; within that range, the distribution is uniform.

#### 4.4: Geometric Distribution

**28**.

1.  A series of Bernoulli trials are conducted until one is a success, and then the experiment stops.
2.  At least one trial is conducted, but there is no upper limit to the number of trials.
3.  The probability of success or failure is the same for each trial.

**29**. *T T T T H*

**30**. The domain of *X* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ….n}. Because you are drawing with replacement, there is no upper bound to the number of draws that may be necessary.

**31**. The domain of *X* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8., 9, 10, 11, 12…27}. Because you are drawing without replacement, and 26 of the 52 cards are red, you have to draw a red card within the first 17 draws.

**32**. *X* ~ *G*(0.24)

**33**. <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mi>μ</mi><mo>=</mo><mtext> </mtext><mfrac> <mn>1</mn> <mi>p</mi> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mtext> </mtext><mfrac> <mn>1</mn> <mrow> <mn>0.27</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mn>3.70</mn> </mrow> </math>

#### 4.5: Hypergeometric Distribution

**35**. Yes, because you are sampling from a population composed of two groups (boys and girls), have a group of interest (boys), and are sampling without replacement (hence, the probabilities change with each pick, and you are not performing Bernoulli trials).

**36**. The group of interest is the cards that are spades, the size of the group of interest is 13, and the sample size is five.

#### 4.6: Poisson Distribution

**37**. A Poisson distribution models the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, when the events are independent and the average rate of the events is known.

**38**. *X* ~ *P*(4)

**39**. The domain of *X* = \{0, 1, 2, 3, …..) i.e., any integer from 0 upwards.

#### 5.1: Continuous Probability Functions

**41**. The discrete variables are the number of books purchased, and the number of books sold after the end of the semester. The continuous variables are the amount of money spent for the books, and the amount of money received when they were sold.

**42**. Because for a continuous random variable, *P*(*x* = *c*) = 0, where *c* is any single value. Instead, we calculate *P*(*c* &lt; *x* &lt; *d*), i.e., the probability that the value of *x* is between the values *c* and *d*.

**43**. Because *P*(*x* = *c*) = 0 for any continuous random variable.

**44**. *P*(*x* &gt; 5) = 1 – 0.35 = 0.65, because the total probability of a continuous probability function is always 1.

**45**. This is a uniform probability distribution. You would draw it as a rectangle with the vertical sides at 0 and 20, and the horizontal sides at <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>1</mn> <mrow> <mn>10</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

. In this distribution, there will be a relatively large numbers of small values, with values becoming less common as they become larger.

This girl is shorter than average for her age, by 0.89 standard deviations.

**60**. 109 + (1.5)(4.5) = 115.75 cm

**61**. We expect about 68 percent of the heights of girls of age five years and zero months to be between 104.5 cm and 113.5 cm.

**62**. We expect 99.7 percent of the heights in this distribution to be between 95.5 cm and 122.5 cm, because that range represents the values three standard deviations above and below the mean.

**65**. Fifty percent, because in a normal distribution, half the values lie above the mean.

**66**. The results of our sample were two standard deviations below the mean, suggesting it is unlikely that 20 percent of the lotto tickets are winners, as claimed by the distributor, and that the true percent of winners is lower. Applying the Empirical Rule, If that claim were true, we would expect to see a result this far below the mean only about 2.5 percent of the time.

#### 7.1: The Central Limit Theorem for Sample Means (Averages)

**67**. The central limit theorem states that if samples of sufficient size drawn from a population, the distribution of sample means will be normal, even if the distribution of the population is not normal.

**68**. The sample size of 30 is sufficiently large in this example to apply the central limit theorem. This theorem \] states that for samples of sufficient size drawn from a population, the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach normality, regardless of the distribution of the population from which the samples were drawn.

**69**. You would not expect each sample to have a mean of 50, because of sampling variability. However, you would expect the sampling distribution of the sample means to cluster around 50, with an approximately normal distribution, so that values close to 50 are more common than values further removed from 50.

. The correct value for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample means is therefore 2.26.

**72**. The standard error of the mean is another name for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample mean. Given samples of size n drawn from a population with standard deviation *σ<sub>x</sub>*, the standard error of the mean is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <msub> <mi>σ</mi> <mi>x</mi> </msub> </mrow> <mrow> <msqrt> <mi>n</mi> </msqrt> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </mrow> </math>

 so you would expect 68 percent of the sample means to be between 69.1 and 70.9. Note that this is a narrower interval due to the increased sample size.

#### 7.2: The Central Limit Theorem for Sums

**81**. For a random variable *X*, the random variable *ΣX* will tend to become normally distributed as the size n of the samples used to compute the sum increases.

**82**. Both rules state that the distribution of a quantity (the mean or the sum) calculated on samples drawn from a population will tend to have a normal distribution, as the sample size increases, regardless of the distribution of population from which the samples are drawn.

**83**. <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display=""> <mrow> <mi>Σ</mi><mi>X</mi><mo>∼</mo><mi>N</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><msub> <mi>μ</mi> <mi>x</mi> </msub> <mo>,</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <msqrt> <mi>n</mi> </msqrt> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub> <mi>σ</mi> <mi>x</mi> </msub> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </mrow> </math>

**84**.The probability is 0.50, because 5,000 is the mean of the sampling distribution of sums of size 40 from this population. Sums of random variables computed from a sample of sufficient size are normally distributed, and in a normal distribution, half the values lie below the mean.

**85**. Using the empirical rule, you would expect 95 percent of the values to be within two standard deviations of the mean. Using the formula for the standard deviation is for a sample sum: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <msqrt> <mi>n</mi> </msqrt> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><msub> <mi>σ</mi> <mi>x</mi> </msub> <mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mn>40</mn> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>7</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>44.3</mn> </mrow> </math>

 so you would expect 95 percent of the values to be between 5,000 + (2)(44.3) and 5,000 – (2)(44.3), or between 4,911.4 and 588.6.

#### 7.3: Using the Central Limit Theorem

**88**. The law of large numbers says that as sample size increases, the sample mean tends to get nearer and nearer to the population mean.

**89**. You would expect the mean from a sample of size 100 to be nearer to the population mean, because the law of large numbers says that as sample size increases, the sample mean tends to approach the population mea.

#### 9.2: Outcomes and the Type I and Type II Errors

**28**. a Type I error

**29**. a Type II error

**30**. Power = 1 – *β* = 1 – *P*(Type II error).

**31**. The null hypothesis is that the patient does not have cancer. A Type I error would be detecting cancer when it is not present. A Type II error would be not detecting cancer when it is present. A Type II error is more serious, because failure to detect cancer could keep a patient from receiving appropriate treatment.

**32**. The screening test has a ten percent probability of a Type I error, meaning that ten percent of the time, it will detect TB when it is not present.

**33**. The screening test has a 20 percent probability of a Type II error, meaning that 20 percent of the time, it will fail to detect TB when it is in fact present.

**34**. Eighty percent of the time, the screening test will detect TB when it is actually present.

#### 9.3: Distribution Needed for Hypothesis Testing

**35**. The Student’s *t*-test.

**36**. The normal distribution or *z*-test.

**37**. The normal distribution with *μ* = *p* and *σ* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi> </mrow> <mi>n</mi> </mfrac> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </math>

**38**. *t*<sub>24</sub>. You use the *t*-distribution because you don’t know the population standard deviation, and the degrees of freedom are 24 because *df* = *n* – 1.

**39**. <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mover accent="true"> <mi>X</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mo>~</mo><mi>N</mi><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mn>0.95</mn><mo>,</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mn>0.051</mn> </mrow> <mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mn>100</mn> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </mrow> </math>

Because you know the population standard deviation, and have a large sample, you can use the normal distribution.

#### 9.4: Rare Events, the Sample, Decision, and Conclusion

**40**. Fail to reject the null hypothesis, because *α* ≤ *p*

**41**. Reject the null hypothesis, because *α* ≥ *p*.

**42**. *H<sub>0</sub>*\: *μ* ≥ 29.0” * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

*H<sub>a</sub>*\: *μ* &lt; 29.0”

**43**. *t*<sub>19</sub>. Because you do not know the population standard deviation, use the *t*-distribution. The degrees of freedom are 19, because *df* = *n* – 1.

**44**. The test statistic is –4.4721 and the *p*-value is 0.00013 using the calculator function TTEST.

**45**. With *α* = 0.05, reject the null hypothesis.

**46**. With *α* = 0.05, the *p*-value is almost zero using the calculator function TTEST so reject the null hypothesis.

#### 9.5: Additional Information and Full Hypothesis Test Examples

**47**. The level of significance is five percent.

**48**. two-tailed

**49**. one-tailed

**50**. *H<sub>0</sub>*\: *p* = 0.8 * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

*H<sub>a</sub>*\: *p* ≠ 0.8

**51**. You will use the normal test for a single population proportion because *np* and *nq* are both greater than five.

### Practice Test 4 Solutions   {#eip-807}

#### 12.1 Linear Equations

**1**. e. A, B, and C. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

All three are linear equations of the form *y* = *mx* + *b*.

**2**. Let *y* = the total number of hours required, and *x* the square footage, measured in units of 1,000. The equation is: *y* = *x* + 4

**3**. Let *y* = the total payment, and *x* the number of students in a class. The equation is: *y* = 100(*x*) + 2,000

**4**. Let *y* = the total cost of attendance, and *x* the number of years enrolled. The equation is: *y* = 3,000(*x*) + 500

#### 12.2: Slope and Y-intercept of a Linear Equation

**5**. The independent variable is the hours worked on a car. The dependent variable is the total labor charges to fix a car.

**6**. Let *y* = the total charge, and *x* the number of hours required. The equation is: *y* = 55*x* + 75 * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

The slope is 55 and the intercept is 75.

**7**. *y* = 55(3.5) + 75 = 267.50

**8**. Because the intercept is included in both equations, while you are only interested in the difference in costs, you do not need to include the intercept in the solution. The difference in number of hours required is: 6.3 – 2.4 = 3.9. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

Multiply this difference by the cost per hour: 55(3.9) = 214.5. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

The difference in cost between the two jobs is $214.50.

#### 12.3: Scatter Plots

**9**. The *X* and *Y* variables have a strong linear relationship. These variables would be good candidates for analysis with linear regression.

**10**. The *X* and *Y* variables have a strong negative linear relationship. These variables would be good candidates for analysis with linear regression.

**11**. There is no clear linear relationship between the *X* and *Y* variables, so they are not good candidates for linear regression.

**12**. The *X* and *Y* variables have a strong positive relationship, but it is curvilinear rather than linear. These variables are not good candidates for linear regression.

#### 12.5: Correlation Coefficient and Coefficient of Determination

**16**. The coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation, or *r*<sup>2</sup>. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

For this data, *r*<sup>2</sup> = (–0.56)2 = 0.3136 ≈ 0.31 or 31%. This means that 31 percent of the variation in fuel efficiency can be explained by the bodyweight of the automobile.

**17**. The coefficient of determination = 0.32<sup>2</sup> = 0.1024. This is the amount of variation in freshman college GPA that can be explained by high school GPA. The amount that cannot be explained is 1 – 0.1024 = 0.8976 ≈ 0.90. So about 90 percent of variance in freshman college GPA in this data is not explained by high school GPA.

Using the calculator function tcdf, the p-value is 2tcdf(2.417, 10^99, 24) = 0.0118. Reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the study produced evidence that the variables are significantly correlated.

#### 12.7: Prediction

**22**. <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mover accent="true"> <mi>y</mi> <mo>^</mo> </mover> <mo>=</mo><mn>25</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>16</mn><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>5</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>105</mn> </mrow> </math>

**23**. Because the intercept appears in both predicted values, you can ignore it in calculating a predicted difference score. The difference in grams of fiber per serving is 6 – 3 = 3 and the predicted difference in grams of potassium per serving is (16)(3) = 48.

#### 12.8: Outliers

**24**. An outlier is an observed value that is far from the least squares regression line. A rule of thumb is that a point more than two standard deviations of the residuals from its predicted value on the least squares regression line is an outlier.

**25**. An influential point is an observed value in a data set that is far from other points in the data set, in a horizontal direction. Unlike an outlier, an influential point is determined by its relationship with other values in the data set, not by its relationship to the regression line.

**26**. The predicted value for y is: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mover accent="true"> <mi>y</mi> <mo>^</mo> </mover> <mo>=</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>+</mo><mn>0.3</mn><mi>x</mi><mo>=</mo><mn>5.6</mn> </mrow> </math>

. The value of 6.2 is less than two standard deviations from the predicted value, so it does not qualify as an outlier. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

Residual for (2, 6.2): 6.2 – 5.6 = 0.6 (0.6 &lt; 2(0.4))

**27**. The predicted value for y is: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mover accent="true"> <mi>y</mi> <mo>^</mo> </mover> </math>

 = 2.3 – 0.1(4.1) = 1.89. The value of 2.32 is more than two standard deviations from the predicted value, so it qualifies as an outlier. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

Residual for (4.1, 2.34): 2.32 – 1.89 = 0.43 (0.43 &gt; 2(0.13))

#### 13.1: One-Way ANOVA

**28**.

1.  Each sample is drawn from a normally distributed population
2.  All samples are independent and randomly selected.
3.  The populations from which the samples are draw have equal standard deviations.
4.  The factor is a categorical variable.
5.  The response is a numerical variable.

**29**. *H<sub>0</sub>*\: *μ*1 = *μ*2 = *μ*3 = *μ*4 * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

*H<sub>a</sub>*\: At least two of the group means *μ*1, *μ*2, *μ*3, *μ*4 are not equal.

**30**. The independent samples *t*-test can only compare means from two groups, while one-way ANOVA can compare means of more than two groups.

**31**. Each sample appears to have been drawn from a normally distributed populations, the factor is a categorical variable (method), the outcome is a numerical variable (test score), and you were told the samples were independent and randomly selected, so those requirements are met. However, each sample has a different standard deviation, and this suggests that the populations from which they were drawn also have different standard deviations, which is a violation of an assumption for one-way ANOVA. Further statistical testing will be necessary to test the assumption of equal variance before proceeding with the analysis.

**32**. One of the assumptions for a one-way ANOVA is that the samples are drawn from normally distributed populations. Since two of your samples have an approximately uniform distribution, this casts doubt on whether this assumption has been met. Further statistical testing will be necessary to determine if you can proceed with the analysis.

#### 13.2: The *F* Distribution

**33**. *SS<sub>within</sub>* is the sum of squares within groups, representing the variation in outcome that cannot be attributed to the different feed supplements, but due to individual or chance factors among the calves in each group.

**34**. *SS<sub>between</sub>* is the sum of squares between groups, representing the variation in outcome that can be attributed to the different feed supplements.

**35**. *k* = the number of groups = 4 * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

*n*<sub>1</sub> = the number of cases in group 1 = 30 * * *

*n* = the total number of cases = 4(30) = 120

**36**. *SS<sub>total</sub>* = *SS<sub>within</sub>* + *SS<sub>between</sub>* so *SS<sub>between</sub>* = *SS<sub>total</sub>* – *SS<sub>within</sub>* * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

621.4 – 374.5 = 246.9

**37**. The mean squares in an ANOVA are found by dividing each sum of squares by its respective degrees of freedom (*df*). * * *

For *SS<sub>total</sub>*, *df* = *n* – 1 = 120 – 1 = 119. * * *

**39**. It would be larger, because you would be dividing by a smaller number. The value of *MS<sub>between</sub>* would not change with a change of sample size, but the value of *MS<sub>within</sub>* would be smaller, because you would be dividing by a larger number (*df<sub>within</sub>* would be 136, not 116). Dividing a constant by a smaller number produces a larger result.

#### 13.3: Facts About the *F* Distribution

**40**. All but choice c, –3.61. *F* Statistics are always greater than or equal to 0.

**41**. As the degrees of freedom increase in an *F* distribution, the distribution becomes more nearly normal. Histogram *F*2 is closer to a normal distribution than histogram *F*1, so the sample displayed in histogram *F*1 was drawn from the *F*<sub>3,15</sub> population, and the sample displayed in histogram *F*2 was drawn from the *F*<sub>5,500</sub> population.

**42**. Using the calculator function Fcdf, *p*-value = Fcdf(3.67, 1E, 3,50) = 0.0182. Reject the null hypothesis.

**43**. Using the calculator function Fcdf, *p*-value = Fcdf(4.72, 1E, 4, 100) = 0.0016 Reject the null hypothesis.

#### 13.4: Test of Two Variances

*Use the following information to answer the next three exercises:* De Anza College keeps statistics on the pass rate of students who enroll in math classes. In a sample of 1,795 students enrolled in Math 1A (1st quarter calculus), 1,428 passed the course. In a sample of 856 students enrolled in Math 1B (2nd quarter calculus), 662 passed. In general, are the pass rates of Math 1A and Math 1B statistically the same? Let A = the subscript for Math 1A and B = the subscript for Math 1B.

**33**. Conduct an appropriate test to determine if the distribution is uniform.

1.  The *p*-value is &gt; 0.10. There is insufficient information to conclude that the distribution is not uniform.
2.  The *p*-value is &lt; 0.01. There is sufficient information to conclude the distribution is not uniform.
3.  The *p*-value is between 0.01 and 0.10, but without alpha (*α*) there is not enough information
4.  There is no such test that can be conducted.
