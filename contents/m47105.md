Recall the [third exam/final exam example](/m47117#element-22).

We examined the scatterplot and showed that the correlation coefficient is significant. We found the equation of the best-fit line for the final exam grade as a function of the grade on the third-exam. We can now use the least-squares regression line for prediction.

Suppose you want to estimate, or predict, the mean final exam score of statistics students who received 73 on the third exam. The exam scores **(*x*-values)** range from 65 to 75. <strong> Since 73 is between the <em>x</em>-values 65 and 75</strong>, substitute *x* = 73 into the equation. Then:

We predict that statistics students who earn a grade of 73 on the third exam will earn a grade of 179.08 on the final exam, on average.

Recently, the annual number of driver deaths per 100,000 for the selected age groups was as follows:

1.  For each age group, pick the midpoint of the interval for the *x* value. (For the 75+ group, use 80.)
2.  Using “ages” as the independent variable and “Number of driver deaths per 100,000” as the dependent variable, make a scatter plot of the data.
3.  Calculate the least squares (best–fit) line. Put the equation in the form of: *ŷ* = *a* + *bx*
4.  Find the correlation coefficient. Is it significant?
5.  Predict the number of deaths for ages 40 and 60.
6.  Based on the given data, is there a linear relationship between age of a driver and driver fatality rate?
7.  What is the slope of the least squares (best-fit) line? Interpret the slope.

    For four *df* and alpha = 0.05, the LinRegTTest gives *p*-value = 0.2288 so we do not reject the null hypothesis; there is not a significant linear relationship between deaths and age.

    Using the table of critical values for the correlation coefficient, with four *df*, the critical value is 0.811. The correlation coefficient *r* = –0.57874 is not less than –0.811, so we do not reject the null hypothesis.

9.  Are there any outliers in the data?
10. Using the least squares line, find the estimated life expectancy for an individual born in 1850. Does the least squares line give an accurate estimate for that year? Explain why or why not.

The maximum discount value of the Entertainment® card for the “Fine Dining” section, Edition ten, for various pages is given in [[link]](#id9216hh080)

{: #id9216hh080 summary="This table presents the page number in the first column and the maximum value ($) in the second column."}

1.  Decide which variable should be the independent variable and which should be the dependent variable.
2.  Draw a scatter plot of the ordered pairs.
3.  Calculate the least-squares line. Put the equation in the form of: *ŷ* = *a* + *bx*
4.  Find the correlation coefficient. Is it significant?
5.  Find the estimated maximum values for the restaurants on page ten and on page 70.
6.  Does it appear that the restaurants giving the maximum value are placed in the beginning of the “Fine Dining” section? How did you arrive at your answer?
7.  Suppose that there were 200 pages of restaurants. What do you estimate to be the maximum value for a restaurant listed on page 200?
8.  Is the least squares line valid for page 200? Why or why not?
9.  What is the slope of the least-squares (best-fit) line? Interpret the slope.

1.  We wonder if the better discounts appear earlier in the book so we select page as *X* and discount as *Y*.
2.  Check student’s solution.

    For seven *df* and alpha = 0.05, using LinRegTTest *p*-value = 0.4736 so we do not reject; there is a not a significant linear relationship between page and discount.

    {: data-type="newline"}
    
    Using the table of critical values for the correlation coefficient, with seven *df*, the critical value is 0.666. The correlation coefficient *xi* = –0.2752 is not less than 0.666 so we do not reject.
5.  There is not a significant linear correlation so it appears there is no relationship between the page and the amount of the discount.

As the page number increases by one page, the discount decreases by $0.01412

We are interested in whether or not the number of letters in a state name depends upon the year the state entered the Union.

1.  Decide which variable should be the independent variable and which should be the dependent variable.
2.  Draw a scatter plot of the data.
3.  Does it appear from inspection that there is a relationship between the variables? Why or why not?
4.  Calculate the least-squares line. Put the equation in the form of: *ŷ* = *a* + *bx*.
5.  Find the correlation coefficient. What does it imply about the significance of the relationship?
6.  Find the estimated number of letters (to the nearest integer) a state would have if it entered the Union in 1900. Find the estimated number of letters a state would have if it entered the Union in 1940.
7.  Does it appear that a line is the best way to fit the data? Why or why not?
8.  Use the least-squares line to estimate the number of letters a new state that enters the Union this year would have. Can the least squares line be used to predict it? Why or why not?
