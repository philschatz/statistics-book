Recall the [third exam/final exam example](/m47117#element-22).

We examined the scatterplot and showed that the correlation coefficient is significant. We found the equation of the best-fit line for the final exam grade as a function of the grade on the third-exam. We can now use the least-squares regression line for prediction.

Suppose you want to estimate, or predict, the mean final exam score of statistics students who received 73 on the third exam. The exam scores **(*x*-values)** range from 65 to 75. <strong> Since 73 is between the <em>x</em>-values 65 and 75</strong>, substitute *x* = 73 into the equation. Then:

We predict that statistics students who earn a grade of 73 on the third exam will earn a grade of 179.08 on the final exam, on average.

After determining the presence of a strong correlation coefficient and calculating the line of best fit, you can use the least squares regression line to make predictions about your data.

1.  For each age group, pick the midpoint of the interval for the *x* value. (For the 75+ group, use 80.)
2.  Using “ages” as the independent variable and “Number of driver deaths per 100,000” as the dependent variable, make a scatter plot of the data.
3.  Calculate the least squares (best–fit) line. Put the equation in the form of: *ŷ* = *a* + *bx*
4.  Find the correlation coefficient. Is it significant?
5.  Predict the number of deaths for ages 40 and 60.
6.  Based on the given data, is there a linear relationship between age of a driver and driver fatality rate?
7.  What is the slope of the least squares (best-fit) line? Interpret the slope.

    For four *df* and alpha = 0.05, the LinRegTTest gives *p*-value = 0.2288 so we do not reject the null hypothesis; there is not a significant linear relationship between deaths and age.

    Using the table of critical values for the correlation coefficient, with four *df*, the critical value is 0.811. The correlation coefficient *r* = –0.57874 is not less than –0.811, so we do not reject the null hypothesis.

{: #idasdgf10411945 summary="This table presents year of birth in the first column and life expectancy in the second column."}

1.  Decide which variable should be the independent variable and which should be the dependent variable.
2.  Draw a scatter plot of the ordered pairs.
3.  Calculate the least squares line. Put the equation in the form of: *ŷ* = *a* + *bx*
4.  Find the correlation coefficient. Is it significant?
5.  Find the estimated life expectancy for an individual born in 1950 and for one born in 1982.
6.  Why aren’t the answers to part e the same as the values in [[link]](#idasdgf10411945) that correspond to those years?
7.  Use the two points in part e to plot the least squares line on your graph from part b.
8.  Based on the data, is there a linear relationship between the year of birth and life expectancy?
9.  Are there any outliers in the data?
10. Using the least squares line, find the estimated life expectancy for an individual born in 1850. Does the least squares line give an accurate estimate for that year? Explain why or why not.
11. What is the slope of the least-squares (best-fit) line? Interpret the slope.
