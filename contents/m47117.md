Data rarely fit a straight line exactly. Usually, you must be satisfied with rough predictions. Typically, you have a set of data whose scatter plot appears to **\"fit\"** a straight line. This is called a **Line of Best Fit**{: data-type="term"} **or** **Least-Squares Line**{: data-type="term"}.

Collaborative Exercise
</div>
If you know a person\'s pinky (smallest) finger length, do you think you could predict that person\'s height? Collect data from your class (pinky finger length, in inches). The independent variable, *x*, is pinky finger length and the dependent variable, *y*, is height. For each set of data, plot the points on graph paper. Make your graph big enough and **use a ruler**. Then \"by eye\" draw a line that appears to \"fit\" the data. For your line, pick two convenient points and use them to find the slope of the line. Find the *y*-intercept of the line by extending your line so it crosses the *y*-axis. Using the slopes and the *y*-intercepts, write your equation of \"best fit.\" Do you think everyone will have the same equation? Why or why not? According to your equation, what is the predicted height for a pinky length of 2.5 inches?

The third exam score, *x*, is the independent variable and the final exam score, *y*, is the dependent variable. We will plot a regression line that best \"fits\" the data. If each of you were to fit a line \"by eye,\" you would draw different lines. We can use what is called a **least-squares regression line**{: data-type="term"} to obtain the best fit line.

Consider the following diagram. Each point of data is of the the form (*x*, *y*) and each point ofthe line of best fit using least-squares linear regression has the form (*x*, *ŷ*).

The *ŷ* is read **\"*y* hat\"** and is the **estimated value of *y***. It is the value of *y* obtained using the regression line. It is not generally equal to *y* from data.

![The scatter plot of exam scores with a line of best fit. One data point is highlighted along with the corresponding point on the line of best fit. Both points have the same x-coordinate. The distance between these two points illustrates how to compute the sum of squared errors.](../resources/fig-ch12_05_02.jpg){: #linrgs_regeq2}



The term *y*<sub>0</sub> – *ŷ*<sub>0</sub> = *ε*<sub>0</sub> is called the **\"error\" or** **residual**{: data-type="term"}. It is not an error in the sense of a mistake. The **absolute value of a residual**{: data-type="term"} measures the vertical distance between the actual value of *y* and the estimated value of *y*. In other words, it measures the vertical distance between the actual data point and the predicted point on the line.

If the observed data point lies above the line, the residual is positive, and the line underestimates the actual data value for *y*. If the observed data point lies below the line, the residual is negative, and the line overestimates that actual data value for *y*.

In the diagram in [\[link\]](#linrgs_regeq2), *y*<sub>0</sub> – *ŷ*<sub>0</sub> = ε<sub>0</sub> is the residual for the point shown. Here the point lies above the line and the residual is positive.

*ε* = the Greek letter **epsilon**

For each data point, you can calculate the residuals or errors, *y*<sub>i</sub> - *ŷ*<sub>i</sub> = *ε*<sub>i</sub> for *i* = 1, 2, 3, ..., 11.

Each \\\|*ε*\\\| is a vertical distance.

For the example about the third exam scores and the final exam scores for the 11 statistics students, there are 11 data points. Therefore, there are 11 *ε* values. If yousquare each ε and add, you get

This is called the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**{: data-type="term"}.

Using calculus, you can determine the values of *a* and *b* that make the **SSE** a minimum. When you make the **SSE** a minimum, you have determined the points that are on the line of best fit. It turns out that the line of best fit has the equation:

# Least Squares Criteria for Best Fit

The process of fitting the best-fit line is called **linear regression**. The idea behind finding the best-fit line is based on the assumption that the data are scattered about a straight line. The criteria for the best fit line is that the sum of the squared errors (SSE) is minimized, that is, made as small as possible. Any other line you might choose would have a higher SSE than the best fit line. This best fit line is called the <strong> least-squares regression line </strong>.

<div data-type="title" class="title">
Note
</div>
Computer spreadsheets, statistical software, and many calculators can quickly calculate the best-fit line and create the graphs. The calculations tend to be tedious if done by hand. Instructions to use the TI-83, TI-83+, and TI-84+ calculators to find the best-fit line and create a scatterplot are shown at the end of this section.

Reminder
</div>
Remember, it is always important to plot a scatter diagram first. If the scatter plot indicates that there is a linear relationship between the variables, then it is reasonable to use a best fit line to make predictions for *y* given *x* within the domain of *x*-values in the sample data, **but not necessarily for *x*-values outside that domain.** You could use the line to predict the final exam score for a student who earned a grade of 73 on the third exam. You should NOT use the line to predict the final exam score for a student who earned a grade of 50 on the third exam, because 50 is not within the domain of the *x*-values in the sample data, which are between 65 and 75.

</div>

# UNDERSTANDING SLOPE

The slope of the line, *b*, describes how changes in the variables are related. It is important to interpret the slope of the line in the context of the situation represented by the data. You should be able to write a sentence interpreting the slope in plain English.

**INTERPRETATION OF THE SLOPE:** The slope of the best-fit line tells us how the dependent variable (*y*) changes for every one unit increase in the independent (*x*) variable, on average.

<span data-type="title">THIRD EXAM vs FINAL EXAM EXAMPLE</span>Slope: The slope of the line is *b* = 4.83. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

Interpretation: For a one-point increase in the score on the third exam, the final exam score increases by 4.83 points, on average.

# The Correlation Coefficient *r*   {#eip-737}

Besides looking at the scatter plot and seeing that a line seems reasonable, how can you tell if the line is a good predictor? Use the correlation coefficient as another indicator (besides the scatterplot) of the strength of the relationship between *x* and *y*.

The <strong>correlation coefficient, <em>r</em>, </strong> developed by Karl Pearson in the early 1900s, is numerical and provides a measure of strength and direction of the linear association between the independent variable *x* and the dependent variable *y*.

The correlation coefficient is calculated as

<div data-type="equation" class="equation" id="eip-id4561593">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"> <mrow> <mi>r</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>Σ</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>x</mi><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>−</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Σ</mi><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Σ</mi><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mrow><mo>[</mo> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>Σ</mi><msup> <mi>x</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msup> <mo>−</mo><msup> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Σ</mi><mi>x</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> <mo>]</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>[</mo> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>Σ</mi><msup> <mi>y</mi> <mn>2</mn> </msup> <mo>−</mo><msup> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>Σ</mi><mi>y</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> <mo>]</mo></mrow> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>
</div>

where *n* = the number of data points.

If you suspect a linear relationship between *x* and *y*, then *r* can measure how strong the linear relationship is.

The formula for *r* looks formidable. However, computer spreadsheets, statistical software, and many calculators can quickly calculate *r*. The correlation coefficient *r* is the bottom item in the output screens for the LinRegTTest on the TI-83, TI-83+, or TI-84+ calculator (see previous section for instructions).

# Chapter Review   {#eip-993}

A regression line, or a line of best fit, can be drawn on a scatter plot and used to predict outcomes for the *x* and *y* variables in a given data set or sample data. There are several ways to find a regression line, but usually the least-squares regression line is used because it creates a uniform line. Residuals, also called “errors,” measure the distance from the actual value of *y* and the estimated value of *y*. The Sum of Squared Errors, when set to its minimum, calculates the points on the line of best fit. Regression lines can be used to predict values within the given set of data, but should not be used to make predictions for values outside the set of data.

The correlation coefficient *r* measures the strength of the linear association between *x* and *y*. The variable *r* has to be between –1 and +1. When *r* is positive, the *x* and *y* will tend to increase and decrease together. When *r* is negative, *x* will increase and *y* will decrease, or the opposite, *x* will decrease and *y* will increase. The coefficient of determination *r*<sup>2</sup>, is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient. When expressed as a percent, *r*<sup>2</sup> represents the percent of variation in the dependent variable *y* that can be explained by variation in the independent variable *x* using the regression line.

Coefficient of Correlation
: {: #id1167925021109} a measure developed by Karl Pearson (early 1900s) that gives the strength of association between the independent variable and the dependent variable; the formula is:
