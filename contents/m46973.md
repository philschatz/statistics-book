The shaded area in the following graph indicates the area to the left of *x*. This area is represented by the probability *P*(*X* &lt; *x*). Normal tables, computers, and calculators provide or calculate the probability *P*(*X* &lt; *x*).

### Calculations of Probabilities

Probabilities are calculated using technology. There are instructions given as necessary for the TI-83+ and TI-84 calculators.

You get 1E99 (= 10<sup>99</sup>) by pressing `1`, the `EE` key (a 2nd key) and then `99`. Or, you can enter `10^99` instead. The number 10<sup>99</sup> is way out in the right tail of the normal curve. We are calculating the area between 65 and 10<sup>99</sup>. In some instances, the lower number of the area might be –1E99 (= –10<sup>99</sup>). The number –10<sup>99</sup> is way out in the left tail of the normal curve.

Historical Note

The TI probability program calculates a *z*-score and then the probability from the *z*-score. Before technology, the *z*-score was looked up in a standard normal probability table (because the math involved is too cumbersome) to find the probability. In this example, a standard normal table with area to the left of the *z*-score was used. You calculate the *z*-score and look up the area to the left. The probability is the area to the right.

### Chapter Review   {#eip-424}

The normal distribution, which is continuous, is the most important of all the probability distributions. Its graph is bell-shaped. This bell-shaped curve is used in almost all disciplines. Since it is a continuous distribution, the total area under the curve is one. The parameters of the normal are the mean *µ* and the standard deviation *σ*. A special normal distribution, called the standard normal distribution is the distribution of *z*-scores. Its mean is zero, and its standard deviation is one.

### Formula Review   {#eip-108}

Normal Distribution: *X* ~ *N*(*µ*, *σ*) where *µ* is the mean and *σ* is the standard deviation.

Standard Normal Distribution: *Z* ~ *N*(0, 1).

Calculator function for probability: normalcdf (lower *x* value of the area, upper *x* value of the area, mean, standard deviation)

Calculator function for the *k*<sup>th</sup> percentile: *k* = invNorm (area to the left of *k*, mean, standard deviation)

Suppose that Ricardo and Anita attend different colleges. Ricardo’s GPA is the same as the average GPA at his school. Anita’s GPA is 0.70 standard deviations above her school average. In complete sentences, explain why each of the following statements may be false.

1.  Ricardo’s actual GPA is lower than Anita’s actual GPA.
2.  Ricardo is not passing because his *z*-score is zero.
3.  Anita is in the 70<sup>th</sup> percentile of students at her college.

{: #element-666 summary="The table is a sample of the capacity of 60 sports stadiums ordered by the maximum number of spectators. Horse racing and motor racing stadiums are not included."}

1.  Calculate the sample mean and the sample standard deviation for the maximum capacity of sports stadiums (the data).
2.  Construct a histogram.
3.  Draw a smooth curve through the midpoints of the tops of the bars of the histogram.
4.  In words, describe the shape of your histogram and smooth curve.
5.  Let the sample mean approximate *μ* and the sample standard deviation approximate *σ*. The distribution of *X* can then be approximated by *X* ~ \_\_\_\_\_(\_\_\_\_\_,\_\_\_\_\_).
6.  Use the distribution in part e to calculate the probability that the maximum capacity of sports stadiums is less than 67,000 spectators.
7.  Determine the cumulative relative frequency that the maximum capacity of sports stadiums is less than 67,000 spectators. Hint: Order the data and count the sports stadiums that have a maximum capacity less than 67,000. Divide by the total number of sports stadiums in the sample.
8.  Why aren’t the answers to part f and part g exactly the same?

An expert witness for a paternity lawsuit testifies that the length of a pregnancy is normally distributed with a mean of 280 days and a standard deviation of 13 days. An alleged father was out of the country from 240 to 306 days before the birth of the child, so the pregnancy would have been less than 240 days or more than 306 days long if he was the father. The birth was uncomplicated, and the child needed no medical intervention. What is the probability that he was NOT the father? What is the probability that he could be the father? Calculate the *z*-scores first, and then use those to calculate the probability.

A NUMMI assembly line, which has been operating since 1984, has built an average of 6,000 cars and trucks a week. Generally, 10% of the cars were defective coming off the assembly line. Suppose we draw a random sample of *n* = 100 cars. Let *X* represent the number of defective cars in the sample. What can we say about *X* in regard to the 68-95-99.7 empirical rule (one standard deviation, two standard deviations and three standard deviations from the mean are being referred to)?
