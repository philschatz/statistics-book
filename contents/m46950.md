title: "Binomial Distribution"
layout: page
---


There are three characteristics of a binomial experiment.

1.  There are a fixed number of trials. Think of trials as repetitions of an experiment. The letter *n* denotes the number of trials.
2.  There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and \"failure,\" for each trial. The letter *p* denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and *q* denotes the probability of a failure on one trial. *p* + *q* = 1.
3.  The *n* trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. Because the *n* trials are independent, the outcome of one trial does not help in predicting the outcome of another trial. Another way of saying this is that for each individual trial, the probability, *p*, of a success and probability, *q*, of a failure remain the same. For example, randomly guessing at a true-false statistics question has only two outcomes. If a success is guessing correctly, then a failure is guessing incorrectly. Suppose Joe always guesses correctly on any statistics true-false question with probability *p* = 0.6. Then, *q* = 0.4. This means that for every true-false statistics question Joe answers, his probability of success (*p* = 0.6) and his probability of failure (*q* = 0.4) remain the same.

The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a **binomial probability distribution**{: data-type="term"}. The random variable *X* = the number of successes obtained in the *n* independent trials.

The mean, *μ*, and variance, *σ*<sup>2</sup>, for the binomial probability distribution are *μ* = *np* and *σ*<sup>2</sup> = *npq*. The standard deviation, *σ*, is then *σ* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </math>

.

Any experiment that has characteristics two and three and where *n* = 1 is called a **Bernoulli Trial**{: data-type="term"} (named after Jacob Bernoulli who, in the late 1600s, studied them extensively). A binomial experiment takes place when the number of successes is counted in one or more Bernoulli Trials.

<div data-type="example" id="element-375" markdown="1">
At ABC College, the withdrawal rate from an elementary physics course is 30% for any given term. This implies that, for any given term, 70% of the students stay in the class for the entire term. A \"success\" could be defined as an individual who withdrew. The random variable *X* = the number of students who withdraw from the randomly selected elementary physics class.

Suppose you play a game that you can only either win or lose. The probability that you win any game is 55%, and the probability that you lose is 45%. Each game you play is independent. If you play the game 20 times, write the function that describes the probability that you win 15 of the 20 times. Here, if you define *X* as the number of wins, then *X* takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 20. The probability of a success is *p* = 0.55. The probability of a failure is *q* = 0.45. The number of trials is *n* = 20. The probability question can be stated mathematically as *P*(*x* = 15).

*X* ~ *B*(*n*, *p*)

Read this as \"*X* is a random variable with a binomial distribution.\" The parameters are *n* and *p*; *n* = number of trials, *p* = probability of a success on each trial.

It has been stated that about 41% of adult workers have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education. If 20 adult workers are randomly selected, find the probability that at most 12 of them have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education. How many adult workers do you expect to have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education?

Let *X* = the number of workers who have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education.

The probability that at most 12 workers have a high school diploma but do not pursue any further education is 0.9738.

The *y*-axis contains the probability of *x*, where *X* = the number of workers who have only a high school diploma.

### Chapter Review

A statistical experiment can be classified as a binomial experiment if the following conditions are met:

1.  There are a fixed number of trials, *n*.
2.  There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and, \"failure\" for each trial. The letter *p* denotes the probability of a success on one trial and *q* denotes the probability of a failure on one trial.
3.  The *n* trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions.

The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a binomial probability distribution. The random variable *X* = the number of successes obtained in the *n* independent trials. The mean of *X* can be calculated using the formula *μ* = *np*, and the standard deviation is given by the formula σ = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mtext> </mtext><msqrt> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </math>

.

### Formula Review

*X* ~ *B*(*n*, *p*) means that the discrete random variable *X* has a binomial probability distribution with *n* trials and probability of success *p*.

*X* = the number of successes in *n* independent trials

*n* = the number of independent trials

*X* takes on the values *x* = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., *n*

*p* = the probability of a success for any trial

*q* = the probability of a failure for any trial

*p* + *q* = 1

*q* = 1 – *p*

The mean of *X* is *μ* = *np*. The standard deviation of *X* is *σ* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </math>

According to a recent article the average number of babies born with significant hearing loss (deafness) is approximately two per 1,000 babies in a healthy baby nursery. The number climbs to an average of 30 per 1,000 babies in an intensive care nursery.

There are two similar games played for Chinese New Year and Vietnamese New Year. In the Chinese version, fair dice with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are used, along with a board with those numbers. In the Vietnamese version, fair dice with pictures of a gourd, fish, rooster, crab, crayfish, and deer are used. The board has those six objects on it, also. We will play with bets being $1. The player places a bet on a number or object. The “house” rolls three dice. If none of the dice show the number or object that was bet, the house keeps the $1 bet. If one of the dice shows the number or object bet (and the other two do not show it), the player gets back his or her $1 bet, plus $1 profit. If two of the dice show the number or object bet (and the third die does not show it), the player gets back his or her $1 bet, plus $2 profit. If all three dice show the number or object bet, the player gets back his or her $1 bet, plus $3 profit. Let *X* = number of matches and *Y* = profit per game.

1.  In words, define the random variable *X*.
2.  List the values that *X* may take on.
3.  Give the distribution of *X*. *X* ~ \_\_\_\_\_(\_\_\_\_\_,\_\_\_\_\_)
4.  List the values that *Y* may take on. Then, construct one PDF table that includes both *X* and *Y* and their probabilities.
5.  Calculate the average expected matches over the long run of playing this game for the player.
6.  Calculate the average expected earnings over the long run of playing this game for the player.
7.  Determine who has the advantage, the player or the house.

6.  Multiply each *Y* value by the corresponding *X* probability from the PDF table. The answer is −0.0787. You lose about eight cents, on average, per game.

Binomial Experiment
: a statistical experiment that satisfies the following three conditions:
  1.  There are a fixed number of trials, *n*.
  2.  There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and, \"failure,\" for each trial. The letter *p* denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and *q* denotes the probability of a failure on one trial.
  3.  The *n* trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions.
^

Bernoulli Trials
: {: #id5444014} an experiment with the following characteristics:
  1.  There are only two possible outcomes called “success” and “failure” for each trial.
  2.  The probability *p* of a success is the same for any trial (so the probability *q* = 1 − *p* of a failure is the same for any trial).
{: #bernoullitr}

Binomial Probability Distribution
: {: #id8181257} a discrete random variable (RV) that arises from Bernoulli trials; there are a fixed number, *n*, of independent trials. “Independent” means that the result of any trial (for example, trial one) does not affect the results of the following trials, and all trials are conducted under the same conditions. Under these circumstances the binomial RV *X* is defined as the number of successes in *n* trials. The notation is: *X* ~ *B*(*n*, *p*). The mean is *μ* = *np* and the standard deviation is *σ* =
