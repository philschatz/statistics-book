There are three characteristics of a binomial experiment. <span data-type="list" data-list-type="enumerated" id="element-591"><span data-type="item">There are a fixed number of trials. Think of trials as repetitions of an experiment. The letter *n* denotes the number of trials.</span> <span data-type="item">There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and \"failure,\" for each trial. The letter *p* denotes the probability of a success on one trial, and *q* denotes the probability of a failure on one trial. *p* + *q* = 1.</span> <span data-type="item">The *n* trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions. Because the *n* trials are independent, the outcome of one trial does not help in predicting the outcome of another trial. Another way of saying this is that for each individual trial, the probability, *p*, of a success and probability, *q*, of a failure remain the same. For example, randomly guessing at a true-false statistics question has only two outcomes. If a success is guessing correctly, then a failure is guessing incorrectly. Suppose Joe always guesses correctly on any statistics true-false question with probability *p* = 0.6. Then, *q* = 0.4. This means that for every true-false statistics question Joe answers, his probability of success (*p* = 0.6) and his probability of failure (*q* = 0.4) remain the same.</span> </span>

The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a **binomial probability distribution**{: data-type="term"}. The random variable *X* = the number of successes obtained in the *n* independent trials.

The mean, *μ*, and variance, *σ*<sup>2</sup>, for the binomial probability distribution are *μ* = *np* and *σ*<sup>2</sup> = *npq*. The standard deviation, *σ*, is then *σ* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </math>

.

Any experiment that has characteristics two and three and where *n* = 1 is called a **Bernoulli Trial**{: data-type="term"} (named after Jacob Bernoulli who, in the late 1600s, studied them extensively). A binomial experiment takes place when the number of successes is counted in one or more Bernoulli Trials.

<div data-type="example" id="element-375" markdown="1">
At ABC College, the withdrawal rate from an elementary physics course is 30% for any given term. This implies that, for any given term, 70% of the students stay in the class for the entire term. A \"success\" could be defined as an individual who withdrew. The random variable *X* = the number of students who withdraw from the randomly selected elementary physics class.

Suppose you play a game that you can only either win or lose. The probability that you win any game is 55%, and the probability that you lose is 45%. Each game you play is independent. If you play the game 20 times, write the function that describes the probability that you win 15 of the 20 times. Here, if you define *X* as the number of wins, then *X* takes on the values 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 20. The probability of a success is *p* = 0.55. The probability of a failure is *q* = 0.45. The number of trials is *n* = 20. The probability question can be stated mathematically as *P*(*x* = 15).

What is the probability that the chairperson and recorder are both students? The names of all committee members are put into a box, and two names are drawn **without replacement**. The first name drawn determines the chairperson and the second name the recorder. There are two trials. However, the trials are not independent because the outcome of the first trial affects the outcome of the second trial. The probability of a student on the first draw is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>6</mn> <mrow> <mn>16</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

A lacrosse team is selecting a captain. The names of all the seniors are put into a hat, and the first three that are drawn will be the captains.

This is not binomial because the names are not replaced, which means the probability changes for each time a name is drawn. This violates the condition of independence.

# Chapter Review

A statistical experiment can be classified as a binomial experiment if the following conditions are met:

1.  There are a fixed number of trials, *n*.
2.  There are only two possible outcomes, called \"success\" and, \"failure\" for each trial. The letter *p* denotes the probability of a success on one trial and *q* denotes the probability of a failure on one trial.
3.  The *n* trials are independent and are repeated using identical conditions.

The outcomes of a binomial experiment fit a binomial probability distribution. The random variable *X* = the number of successes obtained in the *n* independent trials. The mean of *X* can be calculated using the formula *μ* = *np*, and the standard deviation is given by the formula σ = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mtext> </mtext><msqrt> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </math>

.

# Formula Review

*X* ~ *B*(*n*, *p*) means that the discrete random variable *X* has a binomial probability distribution with *n* trials and probability of success *p*.

*X* = the number of successes in *n* independent trials

*n* = the number of independent trials

*X* takes on the values *x* = 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., *n*

*p* = the probability of a success for any trial

*q* = the probability of a failure for any trial

*p* + *q* = 1

*q* = 1 – *p*

The mean of *X* is *μ* = *np*. The standard deviation of *X* is *σ* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msqrt> <mrow> <mi>n</mi><mi>p</mi><mi>q</mi> </mrow> </msqrt> </mrow> </math>

2.  List the values that *X* may take on.
3.  Give the distribution of *X*. *X* ~ \_\_\_\_\_(\_\_\_\_\_,\_\_\_\_\_)

There are two similar games played for Chinese New Year and Vietnamese New Year. In the Chinese version, fair dice with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are used, along with a board with those numbers. In the Vietnamese version, fair dice with pictures of a gourd, fish, rooster, crab, crayfish, and deer are used. The board has those six objects on it, also. We will play with bets being $1. The player places a bet on a number or object. The “house” rolls three dice. If none of the dice show the number or object that was bet, the house keeps the $1 bet. If one of the dice shows the number or object bet (and the other two do not show it), the player gets back his or her $1 bet, plus $1 profit. If two of the dice show the number or object bet (and the third die does not show it), the player gets back his or her $1 bet, plus $2 profit. If all three dice show the number or object bet, the player gets back his or her $1 bet, plus $3 profit. Let *X* = number of matches and *Y* = profit per game.

1.  In words, define the random variable *X*.
2.  List the values that *X* may take on.
3.  Give the distribution of *X*. *X* ~ \_\_\_\_\_(\_\_\_\_\_,\_\_\_\_\_)
4.  List the values that *Y* may take on. Then, construct one PDF table that includes both *X* and *Y* and their probabilities.
5.  Calculate the average expected matches over the long run of playing this game for the player.
6.  Calculate the average expected earnings over the long run of playing this game for the player.
7.  Determine who has the advantage, the player or the house.
