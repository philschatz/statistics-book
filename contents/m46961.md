title: "Poisson Distribution"
layout: page
---


There are two main characteristics of a Poisson experiment.

1.  The **Poisson probability distribution**{: data-type="term"} gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a **fixed interval** of time or space if these events happen with a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. For example, a book editor might be interested in the number of words spelled incorrectly in a particular book. It might be that, on the average, there are five words spelled incorrectly in 100 pages. The interval is the 100 pages.
2.  The Poisson distribution may be used to approximate the binomial if the probability of success is \"small\" (such as 0.01) and the number of trials is \"large\" (such as 1,000). You will verify the relationship in the homework exercises. *n* is the number of trials, and *p* is the probability of a \"success.\"

The random variable *X* = the number of occurrences in the interval of interest.

<div data-type="example" id="element-743" markdown="1">
The average number of loaves of bread put on a shelf in a bakery in a half-hour period is 12. Of interest is the number of loaves of bread put on the shelf in five minutes. The time interval of interest is five minutes. What is the probability that the number of loaves, selected randomly, put on the shelf in five minutes is three?

Let *X* = the number of loaves of bread put on the shelf in five minutes. If the average number of loaves put on the shelf in 30 minutes (half-hour) is 12, **then the average number of loaves put on the shelf in five minutes is** <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>5</mn> <mrow> <mn>30</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </mrow> </math>

(12) = 2 loaves of bread.

The probability question asks you to find *P*(*x* = 3).

*X* ~ *P*(*μ*)

Read this as \"*X* is a random variable with a Poisson distribution.\" The parameter is *μ* (or *λ*); *μ* (or *λ*) = the mean for the interval of interest.

Leah\'s answering machine receives about six telephone calls between 8 a.m. and 10 a.m. What is the probability that Leah receives more than one call **in the next 15 minutes?**

The Poisson distribution can be used to approximate probabilities for a binomial distribution. This next example demonstrates the relationship between the Poisson and the binomial distributions. Let *n* represent the number of binomial trials and let *p* represent the probability of a success for each trial. If *n* is large enough and *p* is small enough then the Poisson approximates the binomial very well. In general, *n* is considered “large enough” if it is greater than or equal to 20. The probability *p* from the binomial distribution should be less than or equal to 0.05. When the Poisson is used to approximate the binomial, we use the binomial mean *μ* = *np*. The variance of *X* is *σ*<sup>2</sup> = *μ* and the standard deviation is *σ* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msqrt> <mi>μ</mi> </msqrt> </mrow> </math>

### Chapter Review

A **Poisson probability distribution**{: data-type="term"} of a discrete random variable gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, if these events happen at a known average rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution may be used to approximate the binomial, if the probability of success is \"small\" (less than or equal to 0.05) and the number of trials is \"large\" (greater than or equal to 20).

### Formula Review

*X* ~ *P*(*μ*) means that *X* has a Poisson probability distribution where *X* = the number of occurrences in the interval of interest.

*X* takes on the values *x* = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

The mean *μ* is typically given.

The variance is *σ*<sup>2</sup> = *μ*, and the standard deviation is * * *

.

When *P*(*μ*) is used to approximate a binomial distribution, *μ* = *np* where *n* represents the number of independent trials and *p* represents the probability of success in a single trial.

A manufacturer of Christmas tree light bulbs knows that 3% of its bulbs are defective. Find the probability that a string of 100 lights contains at most four defective bulbs using both the binomial and Poisson distributions.

</div>
<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
Let *X* = the number of defective bulbs in a string.

Using the Poisson distribution:

* *μ* = *np* = 100(0.03) = 3
* *X* ~ *P*(3)
* *P*(*x* ≤ 4) = poissoncdf(3, 4) ≈ 0.8153

Using the binomial distribution:

* *X* ~ *B*(100, 0.03)
* *P*(*x* ≤ 4) = binomcdf(100, 0.03, 4) ≈ 0.8179

The Poisson approximation is very good—the difference between the probabilities is only 0.0026.

Poisson Probability Distribution
: {: #id14162739} a discrete random variable (RV) that counts the number of times a certain event will occur in a specific interval; characteristics of the variable:
  * The probability that the event occurs in a given interval is the same for all intervals.
  * The events occur with a known mean and independently of the time since the last event.
  
  The distribution is defined by the mean *μ* of the event in the interval. Notation: *X* ~ *P*(*μ*). The mean is *μ* = *np*. The standard deviation is

  . The probability of having exactly *x* successes in *r* trials is *P*(*X* = x ) =

  . The Poisson distribution is often used to approximate the binomial distribution, when *n* is “large” and *p* is “small” (a general rule is that *n* should be greater than or equal to 20 and *p* should be less than or equal to 0.05).
