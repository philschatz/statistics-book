**Box plots**{: data-type="term"} (also called **box-and-whisker plots**{: data-type="term"} or **box-whisker plots**{: data-type="term"}) give a good graphical image of the concentration of the data. They also show how far the extreme values are from most of the data. A box plot is constructed from five values: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. We use these values to compare how close other data values are to them.

To construct a box plot, use a horizontal or vertical number line and a rectangular box. The smallest and largest data values label the endpoints of the axis. The first quartile marks one end of the box and the third quartile marks the other end of the box. Approximately **the middle 50 percent of the data fall inside the box.** The \"whiskers\" extend from the ends of the box to the smallest and largest data values. The median or second quartile can be between the first and third quartiles, or it can be one, or the other, or both. The box plot gives a good, quick picture of the data.

You may encounter box-and-whisker plots that have dots marking outlier values. In those cases, the whiskers are not extending to the minimum and maximum values.

Construct a box plot with the following properties; the calculator intructions for the minimum and maximum values as well as the quartiles follow the example.

* Minimum value = 59
* Maximum value = 77
* *Q*1: First quartile = 64.5
* *Q*2: Second quartile or median= 66
* *Q*3: Third quartile = 70

![Horizontal boxplot with first whisker extending from smallest value, 59, to Q1, 64.5, box beginning from Q1 to Q3, 70, median dashed line at Q2, 66, and second whisker extending from Q3 to largest value, 77.](../resources/fig-ch_02_05_02.jpg){:}


1.  Each quarter has approximately 25% of the data.
2.  The spreads of the four quarters are 64.5 – 59 = 5.5 (first quarter), 66 – 64.5 = 1.5 (second quarter), 70 – 66 = 4 (third quarter), and 77 – 70 = 7 (fourth quarter). So, the second quarter has the smallest spread and the fourth quarter has the largest spread.
3.  Range = maximum value – the minimum value = 77 – 59 = 18
4.  Interquartile Range: *IQR* = *Q*3 – *Q*1 = 70 – 64.5 = 5.5.
5.  The interval 59–65 has more than 25% of the data so it has more data in it than the interval 66 through 70 which has 25% of the data.
6.  The middle 50% (middle half) of the data has a range of 5.5 inches.

For some sets of data, some of the largest value, smallest value, first quartile, median, and third quartile may be the same. For instance, you might have a data set in which the median and the third quartile are the same. In this case, the diagram would not have a dotted line inside the box displaying the median. The right side of the box would display both the third quartile and the median. For example, if the smallest value and the first quartile were both one, the median and the third quartile were both five, and the largest value was seven, the box plot would look like:

 ![Horizontal boxplot box begins at the smallest value and Q1, 1, until the Q3 and median, 5, no median line is designated, and has its lone whisker extending from the Q3 to the largest value, 7.](../resources/fig-ch_02_05_03.jpg){:}

In this case, at least 25% of the values are equal to one. Twenty-five percent of the values are between one and five, inclusive. At least 25% of the values are equal to five. The top 25% of the values fall between five and seven, inclusive.

Box plots are a type of graph that can help visually organize data. To graph a box plot the following data points must be calculated: the minimum value, the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, and the maximum value. Once the box plot is graphed, you can display and compare distributions of data.

1.  In complete sentences, describe what the shape of each box plot implies about the distribution of the data collected for that car series.
2.  Which group is most likely to have an outlier? Explain how you determined that.
3.  Compare the three box plots. What do they imply about the age of purchasing a BMW from the series when compared to each other?
4.  Look at the BMW 5 series. Which quarter has the smallest spread of data? What is the spread?
5.  Look at the BMW 5 series. Which quarter has the largest spread of data? What is the spread?
6.  Look at the BMW 5 series. Estimate the interquartile range (IQR).
7.  Look at the BMW 5 series. Are there more data in the interval 31 to 38 or in the interval 45 to 55? How do you know this?
8.  Look at the BMW 5 series. Which interval has the fewest data in it? How do you know this?
    1.  31–35
    2.  38–41
    3.  41–64

1.  Each box plot is spread out more in the greater values. Each plot is skewed to the right, so the ages of the top 50% of buyers are more variable than the ages of the lower 50%.
2.  The BMW 3 series is most likely to have an outlier. It has the longest whisker.
3.  Comparing the median ages, younger people tend to buy the BMW 3 series, while older people tend to buy the BMW 7 series. However, this is not a rule, because there is so much variability in each data set.
4.  The second quarter has the smallest spread. There seems to be only a three-year difference between the first quartile and the median.
5.  The third quarter has the largest spread. There seems to be approximately a 14-year difference between the median and the third quartile.
6.  *IQR* ~ 17 years
7.  There is not enough information to tell. Each interval lies within a quarter, so we cannot tell exactly where the data in that quarter is concentrated.
8.  The interval from 31 to 35 years has the fewest data values. Twenty-five percent of the values fall in the interval 38 to 41, and 25% fall between 41 and 64. Since 25% of values fall between 31 and 38, we know that fewer than 25% fall between 31 and 35.

Twenty-five randomly selected students were asked the number of movies they watched the previous week. The results are as follows:

### Bringing It Together

<div data-type="exercise">
<div data-type="problem" markdown="1">
Santa Clara County, CA, has approximately 27,873 Japanese-Americans. Their ages are as follows:

| Age Group | Percent of Community |
|----------
| 0–17 | 18.9 |
| 18–24 | 8.0 |
| 25–34 | 22.8 |
| 35–44 | 15.0 |
| 45–54 | 13.1 |
| 55–64 | 11.9 |
| 65+ | 10.3 |
{: summary="This table presents Japanese-Americans and their ages from Santa Clara County. The first column lists the age group and the second column lists the percent of the community. There are 7 rows."}

1.  Construct a histogram of the Japanese-American community in Santa Clara County, CA. The bars will **not** be the same width for this example. Why not? What impact does this have on the reliability of the graph?
2.  What percentage of the community is under age 35?
3.  Which box plot most resembles the information above?

### Glossary
{: data-type="glossary-title"}

Box plot
: a graph that gives a quick picture of the middle 50% of the data
^

First Quartile
: the value that is the median of the of the lower half of the ordered data set
^

Frequency Polygon
: looks like a line graph but uses intervals to display ranges of large amounts of data
^

Interval
: also called a class interval; an interval represents a range of data and is used when displaying large data sets
^

Paired Data Set
: two data sets that have a one to one relationship so that:
  * both data sets are the same size, and
  * each data point in one data set is matched with exactly one point from the other set.
^

Skewed
: used to describe data that is not symmetrical; when the right side of a graph looks “chopped off” compared the left side, we say it is “skewed to the left.” When the left side of the graph looks “chopped off” compared to the right side, we say the data is “skewed to the right.” Alternatively: when the lower values of the data are more spread out, we say the data are skewed to the left. When the greater values are more spread out, the data are skewed to the right.
