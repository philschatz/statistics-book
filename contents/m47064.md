title: "Goodness-of-Fit Test"
layout: page
---


In this type of hypothesis test, you determine whether the data **\"fit\"** a particular distribution or not. For example, you may suspect your unknown data fit a binomial distribution. You use a chi-square test (meaning the distribution for the hypothesis test is chi-square) to determine if there is a fit or not. **The null and the alternative hypotheses for this test may be written in sentences or may be stated as equations or inequalities.**

The test statistic for a goodness-of-fit test is:

<div data-type="equation" id="element-252">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <munder> <mi>Σ</mi> <mi>k</mi> </munder> <mfrac> <mrow> <msup> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>O</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> <mi>E</mi> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>
</div>

where:

* *O* = **observed values**{: data-type="term"} (data)
* {: #element-481} *E* = **expected values**{: data-type="term"} (from theory)
* {: #element-402} *k* = the number of different data cells or categories

**The observed values are the data values and the expected values are the values you would expect to get if the null hypothesis were true.** There are *n* terms of the form <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <msup> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>O</mi><mo>−</mo><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> <mi>E</mi> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

.

The number of degrees of freedom is *df* = (number of categories – 1).

**The **goodness-of-fit test**{: data-type="term"} is almost always right-tailed.** If the observed values and the corresponding expected values are not close to each other, then the test statistic can get very large and will be way out in the right tail of the chi-square curve.

Absenteeism of college students from math classes is a major concern to math instructors because missing class appears to increase the drop rate. Suppose that a study was done to determine if the actual student absenteeism rate follows faculty perception. The faculty expected that a group of 100 students would miss class according to [\[link\]](#M03_Ch03_tbl001).

Employers want to know which days of the week employees are absent in a five-day work week. Most employers would like to believe that employees are absent equally during the week.

The null and alternative hypotheses are:

* *H<sub>0</sub>*: The absent days occur with equal frequencies, that is, they fit a uniform distribution.
* *H<sub>a</sub>*: The absent days occur with unequal frequencies, that is, they do not fit a uniform distribution.

If the absent days occur with equal frequencies, then, out of 60 absent days (the total in the sample: 15 + 12 + 9 + 9 + 15 = 60), there would be 12 absences on Monday, 12 on Tuesday, 12 on Wednesday, 12 on Thursday, and 12 on Friday. These numbers are the **expected** (*E*) values. The values in the table are the **observed** (*O*) values or data.

This time, calculate the *χ*<sup>2</sup> test statistic by hand. Make a chart with the following headings and fill in the columns:

* Expected (*E*) values (12, 12, 12, 12, 12)
* Observed (*O*) values (15, 12, 9, 9, 15)

Now add (sum) the last column. The sum is three. This is the *χ<sup>2</sup>* test statistic.

To find the *p*-value, calculate *P*(*χ*<sup>2</sup> &gt; 3). This test is right-tailed. (Use a computer or calculator to find the *p*-value. You should get *p*-value = 0.5578.)

Next, complete a graph like the following one with the proper labeling and shading. (You should shade the right tail.)

The decision is not to reject the null hypothesis.

**Conclusion:** At a 5% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that the absent days do not occur with equal frequencies.

This problem asks you to test whether the far western United States families distribution fits the distribution of the American families. This test is always right-tailed.

Press `STAT` and `ENTER`. Make sure you clear lists `L1, L2,` and `L3` if they have data in them. Into L1, put the observed frequencies `99, 99.5, 67.3, 62.5, 91, 93.8, 61.9, 91.9, 84.5, 66.4`. Into `L2`, put the expected frequencies `82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82, 82`. Arrow over to list `L3` and up to the name area `"L3"`. Enter `(L1-L2)^2/L2` and `ENTER`. Press `2nd QUIT`. Press `2nd LIST` and arrow over to `MATH`. Press `5`. You should see `"sum"`. `Enter L3`. Rounded to two decimal places, you should see `26.38`. Press `2nd DISTR`. Arrow down to `7:χ2cdf` (or press `7`). Press `ENTER`. Enter `26.38,1E99,9)`. Rounded to four places, you should see `.0018`, which is the *p*-value.

The newer TI-84 calculators have in `STAT TESTS` the test `Chi2 GOF`. To run the test, put the observed values (the data) into a first list and the expected values (the values you expect if the null hypothesis is true) into a second list. Press `STAT TESTS` and `Chi2 GOF`. Enter the list names for the Observed list and the Expected list. Enter the degrees of freedom and press `calculate` or `draw`. Make sure you clear any lists before you start.

# Chapter Review

To assess whether a data set fits a specific distribution, you can apply the goodness-of-fit hypothesis test that uses the chi-square distribution. The null hypothesis for this test states that the data come from the assumed distribution. The test compares observed values against the values you would expect to have if your data followed the assumed distribution. The test is almost always right-tailed. Each observation or cell category must have an expected value of at least five.

[[link]](#fs-idm106414640) contains information from a survey among 499 participants classified according to their age groups. The second column shows the percentage of obese people per age class among the study participants. The last column comes from a different study at the national level that shows the corresponding percentages of obese people in the same age classes in the USA. Perform a hypothesis test at the 5% significance level to determine whether the survey participants are a representative sample of the USA obese population.

| Age Class (Years) | Obese (Percentage) | Expected USA average (Percentage) |
|----------
| 20–30 | 75.0 | 32.6 |
| 31–40 | 26.5 | 32.6 |
| 41–50 | 13.6 | 36.6 |
| 51–60 | 21.9 | 36.6 |
| 61–70 | 21.0 | 39.7 |

<div data-type="solution" markdown="1">
1.  *H<sub>0</sub>*: Surveyed obese fit the distribution of expected obese
2.  *H<sub>a</sub>*: Surveyed obese do not fit the distribution of expected obese
3.  *df* = 4
4.  chi-square distribution with *df* = 4
5.  test statistic = 54.01
6.  *p*-value = 0
7.  Check student’s solution.
8.  1.  Alpha: 0.05
    2.  Decision: Reject the null hypothesis.
    3.  Reason for decision: *p*-value &lt; alpha
    4.  Conclusion: At the 5% level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the surveyed obese do not fit the distribution of expected obese.
