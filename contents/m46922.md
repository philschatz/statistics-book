title: "Measures of the Spread of the Data"
layout: page
---


An important characteristic of any set of data is the variation in the data. In some data sets, the data values are concentrated closely near the mean; in other data sets, the data values are more widely spread out from the mean. The most common measure of variation, or spread, is the standard deviation. The **standard deviation**{: data-type="term"} is a number that measures how far data values are from their mean.

# The standard deviation

* provides a numerical measure of the overall amount of variation in a data set, and
* can be used to determine whether a particular data value is close to or far from the mean.

## The standard deviation provides a measure of the overall variation in a data set

The standard deviation is always positive or zero. The standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close to the mean, exhibiting little variation or spread. The standard deviation is larger when the data values are more spread out from the mean, exhibiting more variation.

Suppose that we are studying the amount of time customers wait in line at the checkout at supermarket *A* and supermarket *B*. the average wait time at both supermarkets is five minutes. At supermarket *A*, the standard deviation for the wait time is two minutes; at supermarket *B* the standard deviation for the wait time is four minutes.

Because supermarket *B* has a higher standard deviation, we know that there is more variation in the wait times at supermarket *B*. Overall, wait times at supermarket *B* are more spread out from the average; wait times at supermarket *A* are more concentrated near the average.

## The standard deviation can be used to determine whether a data value is close to or far from the mean.

Suppose that Rosa and Binh both shop at supermarket *A*. Rosa waits at the checkout counter for seven minutes and Binh waits for one minute. At supermarket *A*, the mean waiting time is five minutes and the standard deviation is two minutes. The standard deviation can be used to determine whether a data value is close to or far from the mean.

**Rosa waits for seven minutes:**

* Seven is two minutes longer than the average of five; two minutes is equal to one standard deviation.
* Rosa\'s wait time of seven minutes is **two minutes longer than the average** of five minutes.
* Rosa\'s wait time of seven minutes is **one standard deviation above the average** of five minutes.

**Binh waits for one minute.**

* One is four minutes less than the average of five; four minutes is equal to two standard deviations.
* Binh\'s wait time of one minute is **four minutes less than the average** of five minutes.
* Binh\'s wait time of one minute is **two standard deviations below the average** of five minutes.
* A data value that is two standard deviations from the average is just on the borderline for what many statisticians would consider to be far from the average. Considering data to be far from the mean if it is more than two standard deviations away is more of an approximate \"rule of thumb\" than a rigid rule. In general, the shape of the distribution of the data affects how much of the data is further away than two standard deviations. (You will learn more about this in later chapters.)

The number line may help you understand standard deviation. If we were to put five and seven on a number line, seven is to the right of five. We say, then, that seven is **one** standard deviation to the **right** of five because 5 + (1)(2) = 7.

If one were also part of the data set, then one is **two** standard deviations to the **left** of five because 5 + (–2)(2) = 1.

![This shows a number line in intervals of 1 from 0 to 7.](../resources/fig-ch02_09_01.jpg){: data-media-type="image/jpg" data-print-width="2.5in"}

* In general, a **value = mean + (#ofSTDEV)(standard deviation)**
* where #ofSTDEVs = the number of standard deviations
* \#ofSTDEV does not need to be an integer
* One is **two standard deviations less than the mean** of five because: 1 = 5 + (–2)(2).

The equation **value = mean + (#ofSTDEVs)(standard deviation)** can be expressed for a sample and for a population. <span data-type="list" data-list-type="bulleted" id="eip-id1164892626854"><span data-type="item">**sample:** <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mi>x</mi><mtext> = </mtext><mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mtext> + </mtext><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mo>#</mo><mi>o</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>D</mi><mi>E</mi><mi>V</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>s</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> </math>

 The symbol <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <apply> <conjugate /> <ci>x</ci> </apply> </math>

 is the sample mean and the Greek symbol <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>μ</mi></math>

 is the population mean.

## Calculating the Standard Deviation

If *x* is a number, then the difference \"*x* – mean\" is called its **deviation**. In a data set, there are as many deviations as there are items in the data set. The deviations are used to calculate the standard deviation. If the numbers belong to a population, in symbols a deviation is *x* – *μ*. For sample data, in symbols a deviation is *x* – <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> </math>

.

The procedure to calculate the standard deviation depends on whether the numbers are the entire population or are data from a sample. The calculations are similar, but not identical. Therefore the symbol used to represent the standard deviation depends on whether it is calculated from a population or a sample. The lower case letter s represents the sample standard deviation and the Greek letter *σ* (sigma, lower case) represents the population standard deviation. If the sample has the same characteristics as the population, then s should be a good estimate of *σ*.

To calculate the standard deviation, we need to calculate the variance first. The **variance**{: data-type="term"} is the **average of the squares of the deviations** (the *x* – <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> </math>

 values for a sample, or the *x* – *μ* values for a population). The symbol *σ*<sup>2</sup> represents the population variance; the population standard deviation *σ* is the square root of the population variance. The symbol *s*<sup>2</sup> represents the sample variance; the sample standard deviation *s* is the square root of the sample variance. You can think of the standard deviation as a special average of the deviations.

If the numbers come from a census of the entire **population** and not a sample, when we calculate the average of the squared deviations to find the variance, we divide by *N*, the number of items in the population. If the data are from a **sample** rather than a population, when we calculate the average of the squared deviations, we divide by ***n* – 1**, one less than the number of items in the sample.

* For the population standard deviation, the denominator is *N*, the number of items in the population.

In these formulas, *f* represents the frequency with which a value appears. For example, if a value appears once, *f* is one. If a value appears three times in the data set or population, *f* is three.

# Sampling Variability of a Statistic

The statistic of a sampling distribution was discussed in [Descriptive Statistics: Measuring the Center of the Data](/m46928). How much the statistic varies from one sample to another is known as the **sampling variability of a statistic**{: data-type="term"}. You typically measure the sampling variability of a statistic by its standard error. The **standard error of the mean** is an example of a standard error. It is a special standard deviation and is known as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the mean. You will cover the standard error of the mean in the chapter [The Central Limit Theorem](/m46983) (not now). The notation for the standard error of the mean is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mi>σ</mi> <mrow> <msqrt> <mi>n</mi> </msqrt> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

 where *σ* is the standard deviation of the population and n is the size of the sample.

**In practice, USE A CALCULATOR OR COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO CALCULATE THE STANDARD DEVIATION. If you are using a TI-83, 83+, 84+ calculator, you need to select the appropriate standard deviation *σ<sub>x</sub>* or *s<sub>x</sub>* from the summary statistics.** We will concentrate on using and interpreting the information that the standard deviation gives us. However you should study the following step-by-step example to help you understand how the standard deviation measures variation from the mean. (The calculator instructions appear at the end of this example.)

## Explanation of the standard deviation calculation shown in the table

The deviations show how spread out the data are about the mean. The data value 11.5 is farther from the mean than is the data value 11 which is indicated by the deviations 0.97 and 0.47. A positive deviation occurs when the data value is greater than the mean, whereas a negative deviation occurs when the data value is less than the mean. The deviation is –1.525 for the data value nine. **If you add the deviations, the sum is always zero**. (For [\[link\]](#element-655), there are *n* = 20 deviations.) So you cannot simply add the deviations to get the spread of the data. By squaring the deviations, you make them positive numbers, and the sum will also be positive. The variance, then, is the average squared deviation.

The variance is a squared measure and does not have the same units as the data. Taking the square root solves the problem. The standard deviation measures the spread in the same units as the data.

Notice that instead of dividing by *n* = 20, the calculation divided by *n* – 1 = 20 – 1 = 19 because the data is a sample. For the **sample** variance, we divide by the sample size minus one (*n* – 1). Why not divide by *n*? The answer has to do with the population variance. **The sample variance is an estimate of the population variance.** Based on the theoretical mathematics that lies behind these calculations, dividing by (*n* – 1) gives a better estimate of the population variance.

NOTE
</div>
Your concentration should be on what the standard deviation tells us about the data. The standard deviation is a number which measures how far the data are spread from the mean. Let a calculator or computer do the arithmetic.

</div>

The standard deviation, *s* or *σ*, is either zero or larger than zero. When the standard deviation is zero, there is no spread; that is, the all the data values are equal to each other. The standard deviation is small when the data are all concentrated close to the mean, and is larger when the data values show more variation from the mean. When the standard deviation is a lot larger than zero, the data values are very spread out about the mean; outliers can make *s* or *σ* very large.

The standard deviation, when first presented, can seem unclear. By graphing your data, you can get a better \"feel\" for the deviations and the standard deviation. You will find that in symmetrical distributions, the standard deviation can be very helpful but in skewed distributions, the standard deviation may not be much help. The reason is that the two sides of a skewed distribution have different spreads. In a skewed distribution, it is better to look at the first quartile, the median, the third quartile, the smallest value, and the largest value. Because numbers can be confusing, **always graph your data**. Display your data in a histogram or a box plot.

The long left whisker in the box plot is reflected in the left side of the histogram. The spread of the exam scores in the lower 50% is greater (73 – 33 = 40) than the spread in the upper 50% (100 – 73 = 27). The histogram, box plot, and chart all reflect this. There are a substantial number of A and B grades (80s, 90s, and 100). The histogram clearly shows this. The box plot shows us that the middle 50% of the exam scores (*IQR* = 29) are Ds, Cs, and Bs. The box plot also shows us that the lower 25% of the exam scores are Ds and Fs.

# Standard deviation of Grouped Frequency Tables

Recall that for grouped data we do not know individual data values, so we cannot describe the typical value of the data with precision. In other words, we cannot find the exact mean, median, or mode. We can, however, determine the best estimate of the measures of center by finding the mean of the grouped data with the formula: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mi>M</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>n</mi><mtext> </mtext><mi>o</mi><mi>f</mi><mtext> </mtext><mi>F</mi><mi>r</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>q</mi><mi>u</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>n</mi><mi>c</mi><mi>y</mi><mtext> </mtext><mi>T</mi><mi>a</mi><mi>b</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>e</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow> <mstyle displaystyle="true"> <mo>∑</mo> <mrow> <mi>f</mi><mi>m</mi> </mrow></mstyle></mrow><mrow> <mstyle displaystyle="true"> <mo>∑</mo> <mi>f</mi> </mstyle></mrow></mfrac></mrow> </math>

{: data-type="newline"}

where <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>=</mo></mrow></math>

 interval frequencies and *m* = interval midpoints.

Just as we could not find the exact mean, neither can we find the exact standard deviation. Remember that standard deviation describes numerically the expected deviation a data value has from the mean. In simple English, the standard deviation allows us to compare how “unusual” individual data is compared to the mean.

For this data set, we have the mean, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover></math>

 = 7.58 and the standard deviation, *s<sub>x</sub>* = 3.5. This means that a randomly selected data value would be expected to be 3.5 units from the mean. If we look at the first class, we see that the class midpoint is equal to one. This is almost two full standard deviations from the mean since 7.58 – 3.5 – 3.5 = 0.58.

# Comparing Values from Different Data Sets

The standard deviation is useful when comparing data values that come from different data sets. If the data sets have different means and standard deviations, then comparing the data values directly can be misleading.

* For each data value, calculate how many standard deviations away from its mean the value is.
* Use the formula: value = mean + (#ofSTDEVs)(standard deviation); solve for #ofSTDEVs.
* <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mo>#</mo><mi>o</mi><mi>f</mi><mi>S</mi><mi>T</mi><mi>D</mi><mi>E</mi><mi>V</mi><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <mtext>value – mean</mtext> </mrow> <mrow> <mtext>standard deviation</mtext> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

* Compare the results of this calculation.

\#ofSTDEVs is often called a \"*z*-score\"; we can use the symbol *z*. In symbols, the formulas become:

John has the better GPA when compared to his school because his GPA is 0.21 standard deviations **below** his school's mean while Ali's GPA is 0.3 standard deviations **below** his school's mean.

John's *z*-score of –0.21 is higher than Ali's *z*-score of –0.3. For GPA, higher values are better, so we conclude that John has the better GPA when compared to his school.

Suppose that a publisher conducted a survey asking adult consumers the number of fiction paperback books they had purchased in the previous month. The results are summarized in the [[link]](#table23).

| # of books | Freq. | Rel. Freq. |
|----------
| 0 | 18 |  |
| 1 | 24 |  |
| 2 | 24 |  |
| 3 | 22 |  |
| 4 | 15 |  |

{: #table23 summary="Publisher B is the table with number of books in the first column, from 0-5, 7, 9, frequency in the second column, and relative frequency in the third column which is blank."}

1.  Are there any outliers in the data? Use an appropriate numerical test involving the *IQR* to identify outliers, if any, and clearly state your conclusion.
2.  If a data value is identified as an outlier, what should be done about it?
3.  Are any data values further than two standard deviations away from the mean? In some situations, statisticians may use this criteria to identify data values that are unusual, compared to the other data values. (Note that this criteria is most appropriate to use for data that is mound-shaped and symmetric, rather than for skewed data.)
4.  Do parts a and c of this problem give the same answer?
5.  Examine the shape of the data. Which part, a or c, of this question gives a more appropriate result for this data?
6.  Based on the shape of the data which is the most appropriate measure of center for this data: mean, median or mode?
