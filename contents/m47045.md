title: "Matched or Paired Samples"
layout: page
---


When using a hypothesis test for matched or paired samples, the following characteristics should be present:

1.  Simple random sampling is used.
2.  Sample sizes are often small.
3.  Two measurements (samples) are drawn from the same pair of individuals or objects.
4.  Differences are calculated from the matched or paired samples.
5.  The differences form the sample that is used for the hypothesis test.
6.  Either the matched pairs have differences that come from a population that is normal or the number of differences is sufficiently large so that distribution of the sample mean of differences is approximately normal.

In a hypothesis test for matched or paired samples, subjects are matched in pairs and differences are calculated. The differences are the data. The population mean for the differences, *μ<sub>d</sub>*, is then tested using a Student\'s-t test for a single population mean with *n* – 1 degrees of freedom, where *n* is the number of differences.

**** A study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of hypnotism in reducing pain. Results for randomly selected subjects are shown in [[link]](#table-2345). A lower score indicates less pain. The "before" value is matched to an "after" value and the differences are calculated. The differences have a normal distribution. Are the sensory measurements, on average, lower after hypnotism? Test at a 5% significance level.

*H<sub>0</sub>*: *μ<sub>d</sub>* ≥ 0

The null hypothesis is zero or positive, meaning that there is the same or more pain felt after hypnotism. That means the subject shows no improvement. *μ<sub>d</sub>* is the population mean of the differences.)

*H<sub>a</sub>*: *μ<sub>d</sub>* &lt; 0

The alternative hypothesis is negative, meaning there is less pain felt after hypnotism. That means the subject shows improvement. The score should be lower after hypnotism, so the difference ought to be negative to indicate improvement.

**Distribution for the test:** The distribution is a Student's *t* with *df* = *n* – 1 = 8 – 1 = 7. Use *t*<sub>7</sub>. **(Notice that the test is for a single population mean.)**

A college football coach was interested in whether the college\'s strength development class increased his players\' maximum lift (in pounds) on the bench press exercise. He asked four of his players to participate in a study. The amount of weight they could each lift was recorded before they took the strength development class. After completing the class, the amount of weight they could each lift was again measured. The data are as follows:

### Chapter Review

A hypothesis test for matched or paired samples (t-test) has these characteristics:

* Test the differences by subtracting one measurement from the other measurement
* Random Variable:
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <msub> <mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mi>d</mi> </msub> </mrow> </math>
  
  = mean of the differences
* Distribution: Student’s-t distribution with *n* – 1 degrees of freedom
* If the number of differences is small (less than 30), the differences must follow a normal distribution.
* Two samples are drawn from the same set of objects.
* Samples are dependent.

*Use the following information to answer the next two exercises.* A new AIDS prevention drug was tried on a group of 224 HIV positive patients. Forty-five patients developed AIDS after four years. In a control group of 224 HIV positive patients, 68 developed AIDS after four years. We want to test whether the method of treatment reduces the proportion of patients that develop AIDS after four years or if the proportions of the treated group and the untreated group stay the same.

Let the subscript *t* = treated patient and *ut* = untreated patient.
