title: "Comparing Two Independent Population Proportions"
layout: page
---


When conducting a hypothesis test that compares two independent population proportions, the following characteristics should be present:

1.  The two independent samples are simple random samples that are independent.
2.  The number of successes is at least five, and the number of failures is at least five, for each of the samples.
3.  Growing literature states that the population must be at least ten or 20 times the size of the sample. This keeps each population from being over-sampled and causing incorrect results.

Comparing two proportions, like comparing two means, is common. If two estimated proportions are different, it may be due to a difference in the populations or it may be due to chance. A hypothesis test can help determine if a difference in the estimated proportions reflects a difference in the population proportions.

The difference of two proportions follows an approximate normal distribution. Generally, the null hypothesis states that the two proportions are the same. That is, *H<sub>0</sub>*\: *p<sub>A</sub>* = *p<sub>B</sub>*. To conduct the test, we use a pooled proportion, *p<sub>c</sub>*.

The problem asks for a difference in proportions, making it a test of two proportions.

Let *A* and *B* be the subscripts for medication A and medication B, respectively. Then *p<sub>A</sub>* and *p<sub>B</sub>* are the desired population proportions.

<span data-type="title">Random Variable:</span> *P′<sub>A</sub>* – *P′<sub>B</sub>* = difference in the proportions of adult patients who did not react after 30 minutes to medication A and to medication B.

*p<sub>A</sub>* – *p<sub>B</sub>* = 0

*H<sub>a</sub>*: *p<sub>A</sub>* ≠ *p<sub>B</sub>*

*p<sub>A</sub>* – *p<sub>B</sub>* ≠ 0

The words **"is a difference"** tell you the test is two-tailed.

**Distribution for the test:** Since this is a test of two binomial population proportions, the distribution is normal:

*P′<sub>A</sub>* – *P′<sub>B</sub>* = 0.1 – 0.06 = 0.04.

Half the *p*-value is below –0.04, and half is above 0.04.

**Conclusion:** At a 1% level of significance, from the sample data, there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a difference in the proportions of adult patients who did not react after 30 minutes to medication *A* and medication *B*.

*Use the following information to answer the next twelve exercises.* In the recent Census, three percent of the U.S. population reported being of two or more races. However, the percent varies tremendously from state to state. Suppose that two random surveys are conducted. In the first random survey, out of 1,000 North Dakotans, only nine people reported being of two or more races. In the second random survey, out of 500 Nevadans, 17 people reported being of two or more races. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the population percents are the same for the two states or if the percent for Nevada is statistically higher than for North Dakota.

"To Breakfast or Not to Breakfast?" by Richard Ayore

In the American society, birthdays are one of those days that everyone looks forward to. People of different ages and peer groups gather to mark the 18th, 20th, …, birthdays. During this time, one looks back to see what he or she has achieved for the past year and also focuses ahead for more to come.

If, by any chance, I am invited to one of these parties, my experience is always different. Instead of dancing around with my friends while the music is booming, I get carried away by memories of my family back home in Kenya. I remember the good times I had with my brothers and sister while we did our daily routine.

Every morning, I remember we went to the shamba (garden) to weed our crops. I remember one day arguing with my brother as to why he always remained behind just to join us an hour later. In his defense, he said that he preferred waiting for breakfast before he came to weed. He said, “This is why I always work more hours than you guys!”

And so, to prove him wrong or right, we decided to give it a try. One day we went to work as usual without breakfast, and recorded the time we could work before getting tired and stopping. On the next day, we all ate breakfast before going to work. We recorded how long we worked again before getting tired and stopping. Of interest was our mean increase in work time. Though not sure, my brother insisted that it was more than two hours. Using the data in [[link]](#fs-idm167762016), solve our problem.

8.  1.  Alpha: 0.05
    2.  Decision: Reject the null hypothesis.
    3.  Reason for Decision: *p*-value &lt; alpha
    4.  Conclusion: At the 5% level of significance, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the mean difference in work times on days when eating breakfast and on days when not eating breakfast has increased.
