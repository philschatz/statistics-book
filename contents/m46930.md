title: "Measures of the Location of the Data"
layout: page
---


The common measures of location are **quartiles**{: data-type="term"} and **percentiles**{: data-type="term"}

Quartiles are special percentiles. The first quartile, *Q*<sub>1</sub>, is the same as the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile, and the third quartile, *Q*<sub>3</sub>, is the same as the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile. The median, *M*, is called both the second quartile and the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile.

To calculate quartiles and percentiles, the data must be ordered from smallest to largest. Quartiles divide ordered data into quarters. Percentiles divide ordered data into hundredths. To score in the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile of an exam does not mean, necessarily, that you received 90% on a test. It means that 90% of test scores are the same or less than your score and 10% of the test scores are the same or greater than your test score.

Percentiles are useful for comparing values. For this reason, universities and colleges use percentiles extensively. One instance in which colleges and universities use percentiles is when SAT results are used to determine a minimum testing score that will be used as an acceptance factor. For example, suppose Duke accepts SAT scores at or above the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile. That translates into a score of at least 1220.

Percentiles are mostly used with very large populations. Therefore, if you were to say that 90% of the test scores are less (and not the same or less) than your score, it would be acceptable because removing one particular data value is not significant.

The **median**{: data-type="term"} is a number that measures the \"center\" of the data. You can think of the median as the \"middle value,\" but it does not actually have to be one of the observed values. It is a number that separates ordered data into halves. Half the values are the same number or smaller than the median, and half the values are the same number or larger. For example, consider the following data. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

1; 11.5; 6; 7.2; 4; 8; 9; 10; 6.8; 8.3; 2; 2; 10; 1 * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

Ordered from smallest to largest: * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8; 7.2; 8; 8.3; 9; 10; 10; 11.5

Sincere there are 14 observations, the median is between the seventh value, 6.8, and the eighth value, 7.2. To find the median, add the two values together and divide by two.

<div data-type="equation" id="element-293">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <apply> <eq /> <apply> <divide /> <apply> <plus /> <cn>6.8</cn> <cn>7.2</cn> </apply> <cn>2</cn> </apply> <cn>7</cn> </apply> </math>
</div>

The median is seven. Half of the values are smaller than seven and half of the values are larger than seven.

**Quartiles**{: data-type="term"} are numbers that separate the data into quarters. Quartiles may or may not be part of the data. To find the quartiles, first find the median or second quartile. The first quartile, *Q*<sub>1</sub>, is the middle value of the lower half of the data, and the third quartile, *Q*<sub>3</sub>, is the middle value, or median, of the upper half of the data. To get the idea, consider the same data set: * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8; 7.2; 8; 8.3; 9; 10; 10; 11.5

The median or **second quartile** is seven. The lower half of the data are 1, 1, 2, 2, 4, 6, 6.8. The middle value of the lower half is two. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

1; 1; 2; 2; 4; 6; 6.8

The number two, which is part of the data, is the **first quartile**{: data-type="term"}. One-fourth of the entire sets of values are the same or less than two and three-fourths of the values are more than two.

The upper half of the data is 7.2, 8, 8.3, 9, 10, 10, 11.5. The middle value of the upper half is nine.

The **third quartile**{: data-type="term"}, *Q*3, is nine. Three-fourths (75%) of the ordered data set are less than nine. One-fourth (25%) of the ordered data set are greater than nine. The third quartile is part of the data set in this example.

The **interquartile range**{: data-type="term"} is a number that indicates the spread of the middle half or the middle 50% of the data. It is the difference between the third quartile (*Q*<sub>3</sub>) and the first quartile (*Q*<sub>1</sub>).

*IQR* = *Q*<sub>3</sub> – *Q*<sub>1</sub>

The *IQR* can help to determine potential **outliers**. **A value is suspected to be a potential outlier if it is less than (1.5)(*IQR*) below the first quartile or more than (1.5)(*IQR*) above the third quartile**. Potential outliers always require further investigation.

The five number summary for the day and night classes is

|  | Minimum | *Q*<sub>1</sub> | Median | *Q*<sub>3</sub> | Maximum |

| **Night** | 25.5 | 78 | 81 | 89 | 98 |
{: summary=""}

1.  The IQR for the day group is *Q*<sub>3</sub> – *Q*<sub>1</sub> = 82.5 – 56 = 26.5
    The IQR for the night group is *Q*<sub>3</sub> – *Q*<sub>1</sub> = 89 – 78 = 11
    
    The interquartile range (the spread or variability) for the day class is larger than the night class *IQR*. This suggests more variation will be found in the day class’s class test scores.

2.  Day class outliers are found using the IQR times 1.5 rule. So,
    * *Q*<sub>1</sub> - *IQR*(1.5) = 56 – 26.5(1.5) = 16.25
    * *Q*<sub>3</sub> + *IQR*(1.5) = 82.5 + 26.5(1.5) = 122.25
    {: data-labeled-item="true"}
    
    Since the minimum and maximum values for the day class are greater than 16.25 and less than 122.25, there are no outliers.
    
    Night class outliers are calculated as:
    
    * *Q*<sub>1</sub> – *IQR* (1.5) = 78 – 11(1.5) = 61.5
    * *Q*<sub>3</sub> + IQR(1.5) = 89 + 11(1.5) = 105.5
    {: data-labeled-item="true"}
    
    For this class, any test score less than 61.5 is an outlier. Therefore, the scores of 45 and 25.5 are outliers. Since no test score is greater than 105.5, there is no upper end outlier.

**Find the 28<sup>th</sup> percentile**. Notice the 0.28 in the \"cumulative relative frequency\" column. Twenty-eight percent of 50 data values is = 14. There are 14 values less than the 28<sup>th</sup> percentile. They include the two 4s, the five 5s, and the seven 6s. The 28<sup>th</sup> percentile is between the last six and the first seven. **The 28<sup>th</sup> percentile is 6.5.**

**Find the median**. Look again at the \"cumulative relative frequency\" column and find 0.52. The median is the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile or the second quartile. 50% of 50 is 25. There are 25 values less than the median. They include the two 4s, the five 5s, the seven 6s, and eleven of the 7s. The median or 50<sup>th</sup> percentile is between the 25<sup>th</sup>, or seven, and 26<sup>th</sup>, or seven, values. **The median is seven.**

**Find the third quartile**. The third quartile is the same as the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile. You can \"eyeball\" this answer. If you look at the \"cumulative relative frequency\" column, you find 0.52 and 0.80. When you have all the fours, fives, sixes and sevens, you have 52% of the data. When you include all the 8s, you have 80% of the data. **The 75<sup>th</sup> percentile, then, must be an eight**. Another way to look at the problem is to find 75% of 50, which is 37.5, and round up to 38. The third quartile, *Q*<sub>3</sub>, is the 38<sup>th</sup> value, which is an eight. You can check this answer by counting the values. (There are 37 values below the third quartile and 12 values above.)

# A Formula for Finding the *k*th Percentile

If you were to do a little research, you would find several formulas for calculating the *k*<sup>th</sup> percentile. Here is one of them.

*k* = the *k<sup>th</sup>* percentile. It may or may not be part of the data.

*i* = the index (ranking or position of a data value)

*n* = the total number of data

* Order the data from smallest to largest.
* Calculate
  <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mi>i</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mi>k</mi> <mrow> <mn>100</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>+</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> </math>

* If *i* is a positive integer, then the *k<sup>th</sup>* percentile is the data value in the *i<sup>th</sup>* position in the ordered set of data.
* If *i* is not a positive integer, then round *i* up and round *i* down to the nearest integers. Average the two data values in these two positions in the ordered data set. This is easier to understand in an example.

# Interpreting Percentiles, Quartiles, and Median

A percentile indicates the relative standing of a data value when data are sorted into numerical order from smallest to largest. Percentages of data values are less than or equal to the pth percentile. For example, 15% of data values are less than or equal to the 15<sup>th</sup> percentile.

* Low percentiles always correspond to lower data values.
* High percentiles always correspond to higher data values.
{: data-bullet-style="bullet"}

A percentile may or may not correspond to a value judgment about whether it is \"good\" or \"bad.\" The interpretation of whether a certain percentile is \"good\" or \"bad\" depends on the context of the situation to which the data applies. In some situations, a low percentile would be considered \"good;\" in other contexts a high percentile might be considered \"good\". In many situations, there is no value judgment that applies.

Understanding how to interpret percentiles properly is important not only when describing data, but also when calculating probabilities in later chapters of this text.

When writing the interpretation of a percentile in the context of the given data, the sentence should contain the following information.

* information about the context of the situation being considered
* the data value (value of the variable) that represents the percentile
* the percent of individuals or items with data values below the percentile
* the percent of individuals or items with data values above the percentile.

Sharpe Middle School is applying for a grant that will be used to add fitness equipment to the gym. The principal surveyed 15 anonymous students to determine how many minutes a day the students spend exercising. The results from the 15 anonymous students are shown.

0 minutes; 40 minutes; 60 minutes; 30 minutes; 60 minutes

10 minutes; 45 minutes; 30 minutes; 300 minutes; 90 minutes;

30 minutes; 120 minutes; 60 minutes; 0 minutes; 20 minutes

Determine the following five values.

* Min = 0
* *Q*<sub>1</sub> = 20
* Med = 40
* *Q*<sub>3</sub> = 60
* Max = 300
{: data-labeled-item="true"}

If you were the principal, would you be justified in purchasing new fitness equipment? Since 75% of the students exercise for 60 minutes or less daily, and since the *IQR* is 40 minutes (60 – 20 = 40), we know that half of the students surveyed exercise between 20 minutes and 60 minutes daily. This seems a reasonable amount of time spent exercising, so the principal would be justified in purchasing the new equipment.

However, the principal needs to be careful. The value 300 appears to be a potential outlier.

*Q*<sub>3</sub> + 1.5(*IQR*) = 60 + (1.5)(40) = 20.

The value 300 is greater than 120 so it is a potential outlier. If we delete it and calculate the five values, we get the following values:

* Min = 0
* *Q*<sub>1</sub> = 20
* *Q*<sub>3</sub> = 60
* Max = 120
{: data-labeled-item="true"}

We still have 75% of the students exercising for 60 minutes or less daily and half of the students exercising between 20 and 60 minutes a day. However, 15 students is a small sample and the principal should survey more students to be sure of his survey results.

# Chapter Review

The values that divide a rank-ordered set of data into 100 equal parts are called percentiles. Percentiles are used to compare and interpret data. For example, an observation at the 50<sup>th</sup> percentile would be greater than 50 percent of the other obeservations in the set. Quartiles divide data into quarters. The first quartile (*Q*<sub>1</sub>) is the 25<sup>th</sup> percentile,the second quartile (*Q*<sub>2</sub> or median) is 50<sup>th</sup> percentile, and the third quartile (*Q*<sub>3</sub>) is the the 75<sup>th</sup> percentile. The interquartile range, or *IQR*, is the range of the middle 50 percent of the data values. The *IQR* is found by subtracting *Q*<sub>1</sub> from *Q*<sub>3</sub>, and can help determine outliers by using the following two expressions.

* *Q*<sub>3</sub> + *IQR*(1.5)
* *Q*<sub>3</sub> – *IQR*(1.5)

The University of California has two criteria used to set admission standards for freshman to be admitted to a college in the UC system:

1.  Students' GPAs and scores on standardized tests (SATs and ACTs) are entered into a formula that calculates an "admissions index" score. The admissions index score is used to set eligibility standards intended to meet the goal of admitting the top 12% of high school students in the state. In this context, what percentile does the top 12% represent?
2.  Students whose GPAs are at or above the 96<sup>th</sup> percentile of all students at their high school are eligible (called eligible in the local context), even if they are not in the top 12% of all students in the state. What percentage of students from each high school are "eligible in the local context"?
