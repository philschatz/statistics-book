title: "Two Population Means with Unknown Standard Deviations"
layout: page
---


1.  The two independent samples are simple random samples from two distinct populations.
2.  For the two distinct populations:
    * if the sample sizes are small, the distributions are important (should be normal)
    * if the sample sizes are large, the distributions are not important (need not be normal)

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="NOTE">
The test comparing two independent population means with unknown and possibly unequal population standard deviations is called the Aspin-Welch t-test. The degrees of freedom formula was developed by Aspin-Welch.
</div>

The comparison of two population means is very common. A difference between the two samples depends on both the means and the standard deviations. Very different means can occur by chance if there is great variation among the individual samples. In order to account for the variation, we take the difference of the sample means, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <msub> <mover accent="true"> <mi>X</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mn>1</mn> </msub> </math>

 – <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <msub> <mover accent="true"> <mi>X</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mn>2</mn> </msub> </math>

, and divide by the standard error in order to standardize the difference. The result is a t-score test statistic.

Because we do not know the population standard deviations, we estimate them using the two sample standard deviations from our independent samples. For the hypothesis test, we calculate the estimated standard deviation, or **standard error**{: data-type="term"}, of **the difference in sample means**, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <msub> <mover accent="true"> <mi>X</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mn>1</mn> </msub> </math>

<span data-type="title">Cohen\'s Standards for Small, Medium, and Large Effect Sizes</span>**Cohen\'s *d***{: data-type="term"} is a measure of effect size based on the differences between two means. Cohen’s *d*, named for United States statistician Jacob Cohen, measures the relative strength of the differences between the means of two populations based on sample data. The calculated value of effect size is then compared to Cohen’s standards of small, medium, and large effect sizes.

Cohen\'s *d* is the measure of the difference between two means divided by the pooled standard deviation: <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mi>d</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac> <mrow> <msub> <mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mn>1</mn> </msub> <mo>–</mo><msub> <mover accent="true"> <mi>x</mi> <mo>¯</mo> </mover> <mn>2</mn> </msub> </mrow> <mrow> <msub> <mi>s</mi> <mrow> <mi>p</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>o</mi><mi>l</mi><mi>e</mi><mi>d</mi> </mrow> </msub> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

The effect is small because 0.384 is between Cohen’s value of 0.2 for small effect size and 0.5 for medium effect size. The size of the differences of the means for the two colleges is small indicating that there is not a significant difference between them.

Weighted alpha is a measure of risk-adjusted performance of stocks over a period of a year. A high positive weighted alpha signifies a stock whose price has risen while a small positive weighted alpha indicates an unchanged stock price during the time period. Weighted alpha is used to identify companies with strong upward or downward trends. The weighted alpha for the top 30 stocks of banks in the northeast and in the west as identified by Nasdaq on May 24, 2013 are listed in [\[link\]](#fs-idm242901296) and [\[link\]](#fs-idm167801152), respectively.

### Homework

*DIRECTIONS: For each of the word problems, use a solution sheet to do the hypothesis test. The solution sheet is found in [Appendix E](/m47882). Please feel free to make copies of the solution sheets. For the online version of the book, it is suggested that you copy the .doc or the .pdf files.*

NOTE
</div>
If you are using a Student\'s *t*-distribution for a homework problem in what follows, including for paired data, you may assume that the underlying population is normally distributed. (When using these tests in a real situation, you must first prove that assumption, however.)

The mean number of English courses taken in a two–year time period by male and female college students is believed to be about the same. An experiment is conducted and data are collected from 29 males and 16 females. The males took an average of three English courses with a standard deviation of 0.8. The females took an average of four English courses with a standard deviation of 1.0. Are the means statistically the same?

A student at a four-year college claims that mean enrollment at four–year colleges is higher than at two–year colleges in the United States. Two surveys are conducted. Of the 35 two–year colleges surveyed, the mean enrollment was 5,068 with a standard deviation of 4,777. Of the 35 four-year colleges surveyed, the mean enrollment was 5,466 with a standard deviation of 8,191.

Mean entry-level salaries for college graduates with mechanical engineering degrees and electrical engineering degrees are believed to be approximately the same. A recruiting office thinks that the mean mechanical engineering salary is actually lower than the mean electrical engineering salary. The recruiting office randomly surveys 50 entry level mechanical engineers and 60 entry level electrical engineers. Their mean salaries were $46,100 and $46,700, respectively. Their standard deviations were $3,450 and $4,210, respectively. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if you agree that the mean entry-level mechanical engineering salary is lower than the mean entry-level electrical engineering salary.

Marketing companies have collected data implying that teenage girls use more ring tones on their cellular phones than teenage boys do. In one particular study of 40 randomly chosen teenage girls and boys (20 of each) with cellular phones, the mean number of ring tones for the girls was 3.2 with a standard deviation of 1.5. The mean for the boys was 1.7 with a standard deviation of 0.8. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the means are approximately the same or if the girls’ mean is higher than the boys’ mean.

For example, if *X* is the number of children in a family, then *x* represents a specific integer 0, 1, 2, 3, ....
