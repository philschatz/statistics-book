title: "Test of Independence"

Tests of independence involve using a **contingency table**{: data-type="term"} of observed (data) values.

The test statistic for a **test of independence**{: data-type="term"} is similar to that of a goodness-of-fit test:

<div data-type="equation" id="element-164">
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <munder> <mi>Σ</mi> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>i</mi><mo>⋅</mo><mi>j</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> </munder> <mfrac> <mrow> <msup> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>O</mi><mo>–</mo><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> <mi>E</mi> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>
</div>

where:

* *O* = observed values
* *E* = expected values
* *i* = the number of rows in the table
* *j* = the number of columns in the table

There are <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>i</mi><mo>⋅ </mo><mi>j</mi></math>

 terms of the form <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <msup> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mi>O</mi><mo>–</mo><mi>E</mi><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> <mi>E</mi> </mfrac> </mrow> </math>

.

**A test of independence determines whether two factors are independent or not.** You first encountered the term independence in [Probability Topics](/m46938). As a review, consider the following example.

<div data-type="note" id="eip-155" data-label="" markdown="1">
<div data-type="title">
Note
</div>
The expected value for each cell needs to be at least five in order for you to use this test.

</div>

<div data-type="example" id="element-54" markdown="1">
Suppose *A* = a speeding violation in the last year and *B* = a cell phone user while driving. If *A* and *B* are independent then *P*(*A* AND *B*) = *P*(*A*)*P*(*B*). *A* AND *B* is the event that a driver received a speeding violation last year and also used a cell phone while driving. Suppose, in a study of drivers who received speeding violations in the last year, and who used cell phone while driving, that 755 people were surveyed. Out of the 755, 70 had a speeding violation and 685 did not; 305 used cell phones while driving and 450 did not.

Let *y* = expected number of drivers who used a cell phone while driving and received speeding violations.

If *A* and *B* are independent, then *P*(*A* AND *B*) = *P*(*A*)*P*(*B*). By substitution,

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mi>y</mi> <mrow> <mn>755</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mn>70</mn> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>755</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow><mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mn>305</mn> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>755</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </mrow> </math>

Solve for *y*\: *y* = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mfrac> <mrow> <mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>70</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>305</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>755</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> <mo>=</mo><mn>28.3</mn> </mrow> </math>

About 28 people from the sample are expected to use cell phones while driving and to receive speeding violations.

In a test of independence, we state the null and alternative hypotheses in words. Since the contingency table consists of **two factors**, the null hypothesis states that the factors are **independent** and the alternative hypothesis states that they are **not independent (dependent)**. If we do a test of independence using the example, then the null hypothesis is:

*H<sub>0</sub>*\: Being a cell phone user while driving and receiving a speeding violation are independent events.

If the null hypothesis were true, we would expect about 28 people to use cell phones while driving and to receive a speeding violation.

**The test of independence is always right-tailed** because of the calculation of the test statistic. If the expected and observed values are not close together, then the test statistic is very large and way out in the right tail of the chi-square curve, as it is in a goodness-of-fit.

The number of degrees of freedom for the test of independence is:

*df* = (number of columns - 1)(number of rows - 1)

The following formula calculates the **expected number** (*E*):

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="block"><mi>E</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mtext>(row total)(column total)</mtext><mtext>total number surveyed</mtext></mfrac></math>

The **observed table** and the question at the end of the problem, "Is the number of hours volunteered independent of the type of volunteer?" tell you this is a test of independence. The two factors are **number of hours volunteered** and **type of volunteer**. This test is always right-tailed.

A vertical upward line extends from 12.99 to the curve and the area to the right of this is equal to the p-value.](../resources/fig-ch11_05_01N.jpg){:}


**Probability statement:** *p*-value=*P*(*χ<sup>2</sup>* &gt; 12.99) = 0.0113

**Compare *α* and the *p*-value:** Since no *α* is given, assume *α* = 0.05. *p*-value = 0.0113. *α* &gt; *p*-value.

**Make a decision:** Since *α* &gt; *p*-value, reject *H<sub>0</sub>*. This means that the factors are not independent.

**Conclusion:** At a 5% level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the number of hours volunteered and the type of volunteer are dependent on one another.

# Chapter Review

To assess whether two factors are independent or not, you can apply the test of independence that uses the chi-square distribution. The null hypothesis for this test states that the two factors are independent. The test compares observed values to expected values. The test is right-tailed. Each observation or cell category must have an expected value of at least 5.

*Use the following information to answer the next eight exercises:* An article in the New England Journal of Medicine, discussed a study on smokers in California and Hawaii. In one part of the report, the self-reported ethnicity and smoking levels per day were given. Of the people smoking at most ten cigarettes per day, there were 9,886 African Americans, 2,745 Native Hawaiians, 12,831 Latinos, 8,378 Japanese Americans and 7,650 whites. Of the people smoking 11 to 20 cigarettes per day, there were 6,514 African Americans, 3,062 Native Hawaiians, 4,932 Latinos, 10,680 Japanese Americans, and 9,877 whites.
