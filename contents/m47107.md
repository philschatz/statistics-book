title: "Outliers"
layout: page
---


In some data sets, there are values **(observed data points)** called **outliers**{: data-type="term"}. **Outliers are observed data points that are far from the least squares line.** They have large \"errors\", where the \"error\" or residual is the vertical distance from the line to the point.

Outliers need to be examined closely. Sometimes, for some reason or another, they should not be included in the analysis of the data. It is possible that an outlier is a result of erroneous data. Other times, an outlier may hold valuable information about the population under study and should remain included in the data. The key is to examine carefully what causes a data point to be an outlier.

Besides outliers, a sample may contain one or a few points that are called **influential points**{: data-type="term"}. Influential points are observed data points that are far from the other observed data points in the horizontal direction. These points may have a big effect on the slope of the regression line. To begin to identify an influential point, you can remove it from the data set and see if the slope of the regression line is changed significantly.

Computers and many calculators can be used to identify outliers from the data. Computer output for regression analysis will often identify both outliers and influential points so that you can examine them.

### Identifying Outliers

We could guess at outliers by looking at a graph of the scatterplot and best fit-line. However, we would like some guideline as to how far away a point needs to be in order to be considered an outlier. <strong> As a rough rule of thumb, we can flag any point that is located further than two standard deviations above or below the best-fit line as an outlier</strong>. The standard deviation used is the standard deviation of the residuals or errors.

We can do this visually in the scatter plot by drawing an extra pair of lines that are two standard deviations above and below the best-fit line. Any data points that are outside this extra pair of lines are flagged as potential outliers. Or we can do this numerically by calculating each residual and comparing it to twice the standard deviation. On the TI-83, 83+, or 84+, the graphical approach is easier. The graphical procedure is shown first, followed by the numerical calculations. You would generally need to use only one of these methods.

In the [third exam/final exam example](/m47117#element-22), you can determine if there is an outlier or not. If there is an outlier, as an exercise, delete it and fit the remaining data to a new line. For this example, the new line ought to fit the remaining data better. This means the **SSE** should be smaller and the correlation coefficient ought to be closer to 1 or –1.

<span data-type="title">Graphical Identification of Outliers</span>With the TI-83, 83+, 84+ graphing calculators, it is easy to identify the outliers graphically and visually. If we were to measure the vertical distance from any data point to the corresponding point on the line of best fit and that distance were equal to 2*s* or more, then we would consider the data point to be "too far" from the line of best fit. We need to find and graph the lines that are two standard deviations below and above the regression line. Any points that are outside these two lines are outliers. We will call these lines Y2 and Y3:
{: .finger}

As we did with the equation of the regression line and the correlation coefficient, we will use technology to calculate this standard deviation for us. Using the **LinRegTTest** with this data, scroll down through the output screens to find ***s* = 16.412**.

Line Y2 = –173.5 + 4.83*x* –2(16.4) and line Y3 = –173.5 + 4.83*x* + 2(16.4)* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

where *ŷ* = –173.5 + 4.83*x* is the line of best fit. Y2 and Y3 have the same slope as the line of best fit.

Graph the scatterplot with the best fit line in equation Y1, then enter the two extra lines as Y2 and Y3 in the "Y="equation editor and press ZOOM 9. You will find that the only data point that is not between lines Y2 and Y3 is the point *x* = 65, *y* = 175. On the calculator screen it is just barely outside these lines. The outlier is the student who had a grade of 65 on the third exam and 175 on the final exam; this point is further than two standard deviations away from the best-fit line.

Sometimes a point is so close to the lines used to flag outliers on the graph that it is difficult to tell if the point is between or outside the lines. On a computer, enlarging the graph may help; on a small calculator screen, zooming in may make the graph clearer. Note that when the graph does not give a clear enough picture, you can use the numerical comparisons to identify outliers.

### Numerical Identification of Outliers   {#eip-212}

In [\[link\]](#element-4662), the first two columns are the third-exam and final-exam data. The third column shows the predicted *ŷ* values calculated from the line of best fit: *ŷ* = –173.5 + 4.83*x*. The residuals, or errors, have been calculated in the fourth column of the table: observed *y* value−predicted y value = *y* − *ŷ*.

*s* is the standard deviation of all the *y* − *ŷ* = *ε* values where *n* = the total number of data points. If each residual is calculated and squared, and the results are added, we get the SSE. The standard deviation of the residuals is calculated from the SSE as:

Rather than calculate the value of *s* ourselves, we can find *s* using the computer or calculator.

The third column contains the values predicted by the regression line. The fourth column contains the errors or residuals, calculated as the observed y value minus the predicted value."}

We are looking for all data points for which the residual is greater than 2*s* = 2(16.4) = 32.8 or less than –32.8. Compare these values to the residuals in column four of the table. The only such data point is the student who had a grade of 65 on the third exam and 175 on the final exam; the residual for this student is 35.

### How does the outlier affect the best fit line?

Numerically and graphically, we have identified the point (65, 175) as an outlier. We should re-examine the data for this point to see if there are any problems with the data. If there is an error, we should fix the error if possible, or delete the data. If the data is correct, we would leave it in the data set. For this problem, we will suppose that we examined the data and found that this outlier data was an error. Therefore we will continue on and delete the outlier, so that we can explore how it affects the results, as a learning experience.

<span data-type="title">Compute a new best-fit line and correlation coefficient using the ten remaining points:</span> On the TI-83, TI-83+, TI-84+ calculators, delete the outlier from L1 and L2. Using the LinRegTTest, the new line of best fit and the correlation coefficient are:
{: .finger}

*ŷ* = –355.19 + 7.39*x* and *r* = 0.9121

The new line with *r* = 0.9121 is a stronger correlation than the original (*r* = 0.6631) because *r* = 0.9121 is closer to one. This means that the new line is a better fit to the ten remaining data values. The line can better predict the final exam score given the third exam score.

### Numerical Identification of Outliers: Calculating *s* and Finding Outliers Manually

If you do not have the function LinRegTTest, then you can calculate the outlier in the first example by doing the following. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

 First, **square each \\\|*y* – *ŷ*\\\|**

The squares are <span data-type="list" data-list-type="labeled-item" id="list1" data-display="inline"> <span data-type="item">35<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">17<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">16<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">6<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">19<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">9<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">3<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">1<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">10<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">9<sup>2</sup></span> <span data-type="item">1<sup>2</sup></span> </span>

**Then, add (sum) all the \\\|*y* – *ŷ*\\\| squared terms** using the formula

<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mover> <mrow> <munder> <mi>Σ</mi> <mrow> <mi>i</mi><mo> </mo><mo>=</mo><mo> </mo><mn>1</mn> </mrow> </munder> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>11</mn> </mrow> </mover> <msup> <mrow> <mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mo>\|</mo><msub> <mi>y</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub> <mo>−</mo><msub> <mover accent="true"> <mi>y</mi> <mo>^</mo> </mover> <mi>i</mi> </msub> <mo>\|</mo> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </mrow> <mn>2</mn> </msup> <mo>=</mo><mover> <mrow> <munder> <mi>Σ</mi> <mrow> <mi>i</mi><mo> </mo><mo>=</mo><mo> </mo><mn>1</mn> </mrow> </munder> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>11</mn> </mrow> </mover> <msub> <mi>ε</mi> <mi>i</mi> </msub> <msup> <mrow /> <mn>2</mn> </msup> </mrow> </math>

 (Recall that *y*<sub>i</sub> – *ŷ*<sub>i</sub> = *ε*<sub>i</sub>.)

= 35<sup>2</sup> + 17<sup>2</sup> + 16<sup>2</sup> + 6<sup>2</sup> + 19<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup> + 10<sup>2</sup> + 9<sup>2</sup> + 1<sup>2</sup>

= 2440 = **SSE**. The result, **SSE** is the Sum of Squared Errors.

**Next, calculate *s*, the standard deviation of all the *y* – *ŷ* = *ε* values where *n* = the total number of data points.**

The calculation is <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo> <msqrt> <mfrac> <mrow><mtext>SSE</mtext></mrow> <mrow><mi>n</mi><mo>–</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow> </mfrac> </msqrt> </math>

.

For the third exam/final exam problem, <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo> <msqrt> <mfrac> <mrow><mn>2440</mn></mrow> <mrow><mn>11</mn><mo>–</mo><mn>2</mn></mrow> </mfrac> </msqrt> <mo>=</mo><mn>16.47</mn> </math>

.

Next, multiply *s* by 2: * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

(2)(16.47) = 32.94 * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

32.94 is 2 standard deviations away from the mean of the *y* – *ŷ* values.

If we were to measure the vertical distance from any data point to the corresponding point on the line of best fit and that distance is at least 2*s*, then we would consider the data point to be \"too far\" from the line of best fit. We call that point a **potential outlier**{: data-type="term"}.

For the example, if any of the \\\|*y* – *ŷ*\\\| values are **at least** 32.94, the corresponding (*x*, *y*) data point is a potential outlier.

For the third exam/final exam problem, all the \\\|*y* – *ŷ*\\\|\'s are less than 31.29 except for the first one which is 35.

35 &gt; 31.29 That is, \\\|*y* – *ŷ*\\\| ≥ (2)(s)

The point which corresponds to \\\|*y* – *ŷ*\\\| = 35 is (65, 175). **Therefore, the data point (65,175) is a potential outlier.** For this example, we will delete it. (Remember, we do not always delete an outlier.)

<div data-type="note" data-has-label="true" data-label="" markdown="1">
<span data-type="title">Note</span>
When outliers are deleted, the researcher should either record that data was deleted, and why, or the researcher should provide results both with and without the deleted data. If data is erroneous and the correct values are known (e.g., student one actually scored a 70 instead of a 65), then this correction can be made to the data.

</div>

* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

The next step is to compute a new best-fit line using the ten remaining points. The new line of best fit and the correlation coefficient are:

*ŷ* = –355.19 + 7.39*x* and *r* = 0.9121

<div data-type="exercise" id="element-12623">
<div data-type="problem" id="id1171155161094" markdown="1">
Using this new line of best fit (based on the remaining ten data points in the [third exam/final exam example](/m47117#element-22)), what would a student who receives a 73 on the third exam expect to receive on the final exam? Is this the same as the prediction made using the original line?

</div>
<div data-type="solution" id="id1171158788502" markdown="1">
Using the new line of best fit, *ŷ* = –355.19 + 7.39(73) = 184.28. A student who scored 73 points on the third exam would expect to earn 184 points on the final exam. * * *
{: data-type="newline"}

* * *
{: data-type="newline"}

 The original line predicted *ŷ* = –173.51 + 4.83(73) = 179.08 so the prediction using the new line with the outlier eliminated differs from the original prediction.

In the example, notice the pattern of the points compared to the line. Although the correlation coefficient is significant, the pattern in the scatterplot indicates that a curve would be a more appropriate model to use than a line. In this example, a statistician should prefer to use other methods to fit a curve to this data, rather than model the data with the line we found. In addition to doing the calculations, it is always important to look at the scatterplot when deciding whether a linear model is appropriate.

     where s is the standard deviation of the residuals
    
    If any point is above y<sub>2</sub> or below y<sub>3</sub> then the point is considered to be an outlier.

2.  Use the residuals and compare their absolute values to 2*s* where *s* is the standard deviation of the residuals. If the absolute value of any residual is greater than or equal to 2*s*, then the corresponding point is an outlier.
3.  Note: The calculator function LinRegTTest (STATS TESTS LinRegTTest) calculates *s*.

a. and b. Check student’s solution.

c. The slope of the regression line is -0.3031 with a y-intercept of 31.93. In context, the y-intercept indicates that when there are no returning sparrow hawks, there will be almost 32% new sparrow hawks, which doesn’t make sense since if there are no returning birds, then the new percentage would have to be 100% (this is an example of why we do not extrapolate). The slope tells us that for each percentage increase in returning birds, the percentage of new birds in the colony decreases by 30.3%.

d. If we examine r2, we see that only 57.52% of the variation in the percent of new birds is explained by the model and the correlation coefficient, r = –.7584 only indicates a somewhat strong correlation between returning and new percentages.

e. The ordered pair (66, 6) generates the largest residual of 6.0. This means that when the observed return percentage is 66%, our observed new percentage, 6%, is almost 6% less than the predicted new value of 11.98%. If we remove this data pair, we see only an adjusted slope of -.2789 and an adjusted intercept of 30.9816. In other words, even though this data generates the largest residual, it is not an outlier, nor is the data pair an influential point.

f. If there are 70% returning birds, we would expect to see y = –.2789(70) + 30.9816 = 0.114 or 11.4% new birds in the colony.

3.  We have a slope of –1.4946 with a *y*-intercept of 193.88. The slope, in context, indicates that for each additional minute added to the swim time, the heart rate will decrease by 1.5 beats per minute. If the student is not swimming at all, the *y*-intercept indicates that his heart rate will be 193.88 beats per minute. While the slope has meaning (the longer it takes to swim 2,000 meters, the less effort the heart puts out), the *y*-intercept does not make sense. If the athlete is not swimming (resting), then his heart rate should be very low.
4.  Since only 1.5% of the heart rate variation is explained by this regression equation, we must conclude that this association is not explained with a linear relationship.
5.  The point (34.72, 124) generates the largest residual of –11.82. This means that our observed heart rate is almost 12 beats less than our predicted rate of 136 beats per minute. When this point is removed, the slope becomes –2.953 with the y-intercept changing to 247.1616. While the linear association is still very weak, we see that the removed data pair can be considered an influential point in the sense that the *y*-intercept becomes more meaningful.

We are interested in whether there is a relationship between the ranking of a state and the area of the state.

1.  What are the independent and dependent variables?
2.  What do you think the scatter plot will look like? Make a scatter plot of the data.
3.  Does it appear from inspection that there is a relationship between the variables? Why or why not?
4.  Calculate the least-squares line. Put the equation in the form of: *ŷ* = *a* + *bx*
5.  Find the correlation coefficient. What does it imply about the significance of the relationship?
6.  Find the estimated areas for Alabama and for Colorado. Are they close to the actual areas?
7.  Use the two points in part f to plot the least-squares line on your graph from part b.
8.  Does it appear that a line is the best way to fit the data? Why or why not?
9.  Are there any outliers?
10. Use the least squares line to estimate the area of a new state that enters the Union. Can the least-squares line be used to predict it? Why or why not?
11. Delete “Hawaii” and substitute “Alaska” for it. Alaska is the forty-ninth, state with an area of 656,424 square miles.
12. Calculate the new least-squares line.
13. Find the estimated area for Alabama. Is it closer to the actual area with this new least-squares line or with the previous one that included Hawaii? Why do you think that’s the case?
14. Do you think that, in general, newer states are larger than the original states?

1.  Let rank be the independent variable and area be the dependent variable.
2.  Check student’s solution.
3.  There appears to be a linear relationship, with one outlier.
4.  *ŷ* (area) = 24177.06 + 1010.478*x*
5.  *r* = 0.50047, *r* is not significant so there is no relationship between the variables.
6.  Alabama: 46407.576 Colorado: 62575.224
7.  Alabama estimate is closer than Colorado estimate.
8.  If the outlier is removed, there is a linear relationship.
9.  There is one outlier (Hawaii).
10. rank 51: 75711.4; no
