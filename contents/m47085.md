A **test of a single variance**{: data-type="term"} assumes that the underlying distribution is **normal**. The null and alternative hypotheses are stated in terms of the **population variance**{: data-type="term"} (or population standard deviation). The test statistic is:

You may think of *s* as the random variable in this test. The number of degrees of freedom is *df* = *n* - 1. **A test of a single variance may be right-tailed, left-tailed, or two-tailed.** [\[link\]](#element-174) will show you how to set up the null and alternative hypotheses. The null and alternative hypotheses contain statements about the population variance.

Math instructors are not only interested in how their students do on exams, on average, but how the exam scores vary. To many instructors, the variance (or standard deviation) may be more important than the average.

Suppose a math instructor believes that the standard deviation for his final exam is five points. One of his best students thinks otherwise. The student claims that the standard deviation is more than five points. If the student were to conduct a hypothesis test, what would the null and alternative hypotheses be?

Even though we are given the population standard deviation, we can set up the test using the population variance as follows.

A SCUBA instructor wants to record the collective depths each of his students dives during their checkout. He is interested in how the depths vary, even though everyone should have been at the same depth. He believes the standard deviation is three feet.

With individual lines at its various windows, a post office finds that the standard deviation for normally distributed waiting times for customers on Friday afternoon is 7.2 minutes. The post office experiments with a single, main waiting line and finds that for a random sample of 25 customers, the waiting times for customers have a standard deviation of 3.5 minutes.

With a significance level of 5%, test the claim that **a single line causes lower variation among waiting times (shorter waiting times) for customers**.

Since the claim is that a single line causes less variation, this is a test of a single variance. The parameter is the population variance, *σ*<sup>2</sup>, or the population standard deviation, *σ*.

**Random Variable:** The sample standard deviation, *s*, is the random variable. Let *s* = standard deviation for the waiting times.

* *H<sub>0</sub>*: *σ*<sup>2</sup> = 7.2<sup>2</sup>
* *H<sub>a</sub>*: *σ*<sup>2</sup> &lt; 7.2<sup>2</sup>

The word **"less"** tells you this is a left-tailed test.

where *n* = 25, *s* = 3.5, and *σ* = 7.2.

**Graph:**

![This is a nonsymmetrical chi-square curve with values of 0 and 5.67 labeled on the horizontal axis. The point 5.67 lies to the left of the peak of the curve. A vertical upward line extends from 5.67 to the curve and the region to the left of this line is shaded. The shaded area is equal to the p-value.](../resources/figure-ch11_08_01.jpg){:}


**Probability statement:** *p*-value = *P* ( *χ*<sup>2</sup> &lt; 5.67) = 0.000042

**Make a decision:** Since *α* &gt; *p*-value, reject *H<sub>0</sub>*. This means that you reject *σ*<sup>2</sup> = 7.2<sup>2</sup>. In other words, you do not think the variation in waiting times is 7.2 minutes; you think the variation in waiting times is less.

**Conclusion:** At a 5% level of significance, from the data, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that a single line causes a lower variation among the waiting times **or** with a single line, the customer waiting times vary less than 7.2 minutes.

The FCC conducts broadband speed tests to measure how much data per second passes between a consumer’s computer and the internet. As of August of 2012, the standard deviation of Internet speeds across Internet Service Providers (ISPs) was 12.2 percent. Suppose a sample of 15 ISPs is taken, and the standard deviation is 13.2.

# Chapter Review

To test variability, use the chi-square test of a single variance. The test may be left-, right-, or two-tailed, and its hypotheses are always expressed in terms of the variance (or standard deviation).

# Homework

*Use the following information to answer the next twelve exercises:* Suppose an airline claims that its flights are consistently on time with an average delay of at most 15 minutes. It claims that the average delay is so consistent that the variance is no more than 150 minutes. Doubting the consistency part of the claim, a disgruntled traveler calculates the delays for his next 25 flights. The average delay for those 25 flights is 22 minutes with a standard deviation of 15 minutes.

You want to buy a specific computer. A sales representative of the manufacturer claims that retail stores sell this computer at an average price of $1,249 with a very narrow standard deviation of $25. You find a website that has a price comparison for the same computer at a series of stores as follows: $1,299; $1,229.99; $1,193.08; $1,279; $1,224.95; $1,229.99; $1,269.95; $1,249. Can you argue that pricing has a larger standard deviation than claimed by the manufacturer? Use the 5% significance level. As a potential buyer, what would be the practical conclusion from your analysis?

A company packages apples by weight. One of the weight grades is Class A apples. Class A apples have a mean weight of 150 g, and there is a maximum allowed weight tolerance of 5% above or below the mean for apples in the same consumer package. A batch of apples is selected to be included in a Class A apple package. Given the following apple weights of the batch, does the fruit comply with the Class A grade weight tolerance requirements. Conduct an appropriate hypothesis test.

(a) at the 5% significance level

(b) at the 1% significance level

Weights in selected apple batch (in grams): 158; 167; 149; 169; 164; 139; 154; 150; 157; 171; 152; 161; 141; 166; 172;
