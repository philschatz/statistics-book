title: "Stem-and-Leaf Graphs (Stemplots), Line Graphs, and Bar Graphs"
layout: page
---


One simple graph, the **stem-and-leaf graph** or **stemplot**, comes from the field of exploratory data analysis. It is a good choice when the data sets are small. To create the plot, divide each observation of data into a stem and a leaf. The leaf consists of a **final significant digit**. For example, 23 has stem two and leaf three. The number 432 has stem 43 and leaf two. Likewise, the number 5,432 has stem 543 and leaf two. The decimal 9.3 has stem nine and leaf three. Write the stems in a vertical line from smallest to largest. Draw a vertical line to the right of the stems. Then write the leaves in increasing order next to their corresponding stem.

The stemplot shows that most scores fell in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. Eight out of the 31 scores or approximately 26% <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"> <mrow> <mrow><mo>(</mo> <mrow> <mfrac> <mn>8</mn> <mrow> <mn>31</mn> </mrow> </mfrac> </mrow> <mo>)</mo></mrow> </mrow> </math>

The stemplot is a quick way to graph data and gives an exact picture of the data. You want to look for an overall pattern and any outliers. An **outlier**{: data-type="term"} is an observation of data that does not fit the rest of the data. It is sometimes called an **extreme value.** When you graph an outlier, it will appear not to fit the pattern of the graph. Some outliers are due to mistakes (for example, writing down 50 instead of 500) while others may indicate that something unusual is happening. It takes some background information to explain outliers, so we will cover them in more detail later.

Another type of graph that is useful for specific data values is a **line graph**. In the particular line graph shown in [\[link\]](#example4), the ***x*-axis** (horizontal axis) consists of **data values** and the ***y*-axis** (vertical axis) consists of **frequency points**. The frequency points are connected using line segments.

### Chapter Review

A **stem-and-leaf plot** is a way to plot data and look at the distribution. In a stem-and-leaf plot, all data values within a class are visible. The advantage in a stem-and-leaf plot is that all values are listed, unlike a histogram, which gives classes of data values. A **line graph** is often used to represent a set of data values in which a quantity varies with time. These graphs are useful for finding trends. That is, finding a general pattern in data sets including temperature, sales, employment, company profit or cost over a period of time. A **bar graph** is a chart that uses either horizontal or vertical bars to show comparisons among categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a discrete value. Some bar graphs present bars clustered in groups of more than one (grouped bar graphs), and others show the bars divided into subparts to show cumulative effect (stacked bar graphs). Bar graphs are especially useful when categorical data is being used.

{: #M01_Ch02_tbl024 summary="The tables represents United States states and Obesity Rates. The first column and third columns list the names of the states and the second and fourth columns list Obesity Rates."}

1.  Use a random number generator to randomly pick eight states. Construct a bar graph of the obesity rates of those eight states.
2.  Construct a bar graph for all the states beginning with the letter "A."
3.  Construct a bar graph for all the states beginning with the letter "M."

1.  Example solution for using the random number generator for the TI-84+ to generate a simple random sample of 8 states. Instructions are as follows.
    * Number the entries in the table 1–51 (Includes Washington, DC; Numbered vertically)
    * Press MATH
    * Arrow over to PRB
    * Press 5:randInt(
    * Enter 51,1,8)
    {: data-labeled-item="true"}
    
    Eight numbers are generated (use the right arrow key to scroll through the numbers). The numbers correspond to the numbered states (for this example: {47 21 9 23 51 13 25 4}. If any numbers are repeated, generate a different number by using 5:randInt(51,1)). Here, the states (and Washington DC) are {Arkansas, Washington DC, Idaho, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Virginia, Wyoming}.
    
    Corresponding percents are {30.1, 22.2, 26.5, 27.1, 30.9, 34.0, 26.0, 25.1}.
