Independent and mutually exclusive do **not** mean the same thing.

# Independent Events   {#element-20}

Two events are independent if the following are true:

* *P*(*A*\\\|*B*) = *P*(*A*)
* *P*(*B*\\\|*A*) = *P*(*B*)
* *P*(*A* AND *B*) = *P*(*A*)*P*(*B*)

Two events *A* and *B* are **independent**{: data-type="term"} if the knowledge that one occurred does not affect the chance the other occurs. For example, the outcomes of two roles of a fair die are independent events. The outcome of the first roll does not change the probability for the outcome of the second roll. To show two events are independent, you must show **only one** of the above conditions. If two events are NOT independent, then we say that they are **dependent**.

Sampling may be done **with** **replacement**{: data-type="term"} or **without replacement**.

* **With replacement**\: If each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, then that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once. When sampling is done with replacement, then events are considered to be independent, meaning the result of the first pick will not change the probabilities for the second pick.
* **Without replacement**\: When sampling is done without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once. In this case, the probabilities for the second pick are affected by the result of the first pick. The events are considered to be dependent or not independent.

If it is not known whether *A* and *B* are independent or dependent, **assume they are dependent until you can show otherwise**.

<div data-type="example" markdown="1">
You have a fair, well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. It consists of four suits. The suits are clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. There are 13 cards in each suit consisting of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, *J* (jack), *Q* (queen), *K* (king) of that suit.

a. Sampling with replacement: * * *
{: data-type="newline" data-count="1"}

Suppose you pick three cards with replacement. The first card you pick out of the 52 cards is the *Q* of spades. You put this card back, reshuffle the cards and pick a second card from the 52-card deck. It is the ten of clubs. You put this card back, reshuffle the cards and pick a third card from the 52-card deck. This time, the card is the *Q* of spades again. Your picks are \{*Q* of spades, ten of clubs, *Q* of spades}. You have picked the *Q* of spades twice. You pick each card from the 52-card deck.

b. Sampling without replacement: * * *
{: data-type="newline" data-count="1"}

Suppose you pick three cards without replacement. The first card you pick out of the 52 cards is the *K* of hearts. You put this card aside and pick the second card from the 51 cards remaining in the deck. It is the three of diamonds. You put this card aside and pick the third card from the remaining 50 cards in the deck. The third card is the *J* of spades. Your picks are \{*K* of hearts, three of diamonds, *J* of spades}. Because you have picked the cards without replacement, you cannot pick the same card twice.

# Mutually Exclusive Events   {#element-462}

*A* and *B* are **mutually exclusive**{: data-type="term"} events if they cannot occur at the same time. This means that *A* and *B* do not share any outcomes and *P*(*A* AND *B*) = 0.

For example, suppose the sample space *S* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. Let *A* = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, *B* = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8}, and *C* = \{7, 9}. *A* AND *B* = \{4, 5}. *P*(*A* AND *B*) = <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mrow><mfrac><mn>2</mn><mrow><mn>10</mn></mrow></mfrac></mrow></math>

 and is not equal to zero. Therefore, *A* and *B* are not mutually exclusive. *A* and *C* do not have any numbers in common so *P*(*A* AND *C*) = 0. Therefore, *A* and *C* are mutually exclusive.

If it is not known whether *A* and *B* are mutually exclusive, **assume they are not until you can show otherwise**. The following examples illustrate these definitions and terms.

<div data-type="example" id="element-931" markdown="1">
Flip two fair coins. (This is an experiment.)

The sample space is \{*HH*, *HT*, *TH*, *TT*} where *T* = tails and *H* = heads. The outcomes are *HH*, *HT*, *TH*, and *TT*. The outcomes HT and TH are different. The *HT* means that the first coin showed heads and the second coin showed tails. The *TH* means that the first coin showed tails and the second coin showed heads.

* Let *A* = the event of getting **at most one tail**. (At most one tail means zero or one tail.) Then *A* can be written as \{*HH*, *HT*, *TH*}. The outcome *HH* shows zero tails. *HT* and *TH* each show one tail.
* Let *B* = the event of getting all tails. *B* can be written as \{*TT*}. *B* is the **complement** of *A*, so *B* = *A′*. Also, *P*(*A*) + *P*(*B*) = *P*(*A*) + *P*(*A′*) = 1.
* The probabilities for *A* and for *B* are *P*(*A*) =

# Chapter Review

Two events *A* and *B* are independent if the knowledge that one occurred does not affect the chance the other occurs. If two events are not independent, then we say that they are dependent.

In Sampling with replacement, each member of a population is replaced after it is picked, so that member has the possibility of being chosen more than once, and the events are considered to be independent. In sampling without replacement, each member of a population may be chosen only once, and the events are considered not to be independent. When events do not share outcomes, they are mutually exclusive of each other.

# Formula Review

If *A* and *B* are independent, *P*(*A* AND *B*) = *P*(*A*)*P*(*B*), *P*(*A*\\\|*B*) = *P*(*A*) and *P*(*B*\\\|*A*) = *P*(*B*).

If *A* and *B* are mutually exclusive, *P*(*A* OR *B*) = *P*(*A*) + *P*(*B*) and *P*(*A* AND *B*) = 0.
